What is genropy-kajenn, in one sentence?
   The way to serve an existing genropy site on an ASGI server (uvicorn) instead
   of WSGI (werkzeug), with no register daemon — and, on demand, across a pool
   of worker processes.

Do I have to change my site?
   No. The ``GnrWsgiSite`` runs unmodified. Same ``root.py``, same auth, same
   sessions. genropy-kajenn changes how the site is served, not what it is.

How is this different from ``gnrwsgiserve``?
   ``gnrwsgiserve`` runs the site under werkzeug (WSGI); ``genropy-kajenn`` runs it
   under uvicorn (ASGI), converting each request to WSGI on a thread pool so the
   site code stays synchronous. What you gain is the worker pool with its
   user-sticky routing, and no register daemon. The command-line experience is
   the same: a site name and a port.

Do I have to choose single or pool?
   No. There is one shape: the pool always runs. It starts with one worker and
   adds another when the ones it has have no room for a newcomer, so a small
   site behaves like a single process and a busy one spreads out on its own.
   ``--workers`` no longer exists. See :doc:`the-pool`.

What happened to the register daemon?
   It is gone. Historically the site register was a separate process reached over
   a wire (Pyro4, then ``genro-nodaemon``). genropy-kajenn serves the register
   **in-process**; there is nothing to start or connect to. It provides the
   ``gnr.web:daemon`` entry point that the legacy resolves, so the legacy imports
   keep working with no daemon behind them. This replaces ``genro-nodaemon``.

Does a user always land on the same worker?
   Yes. In the pool, the routing cookie is ``spa_connection_id`` — the connection
   id the site itself creates (nothing is minted by the front) — and
   routes every request from that user to the worker that holds their session.
   The pin is per user, so their in-process session state stays coherent.

How does the pool decide to grow?
   On **measured occupancy**, not user counts. Each worker reports its cpu,
   executor saturation and (optionally) memory; the commander turns that into an
   occupancy in 0..1. The pool grows when no non-reception worker is under the
   admission threshold (0.8) — the group as a whole is under pressure. A spawn
   already in flight is waited for rather than duplicated. See
   :doc:`the-pool` for the full walk-through.

Can I tune when the pool grows?
   The lever the environment exposes is ``KAJENN_WORKER_MAX_USERS``: how many
   users one worker may hold before it refuses the next. Unset, one worker takes
   everybody and a small site never grows a second one. The occupancy setpoints
   and the memory cascade live on the group, reachable through a ``--config``
   recipe. See :doc:`configuration`.

Is shared global state consistent across workers?
   Yes, eventually. The legacy ``globalStore()`` rides the framework's
   global-store rail: a write on one worker reaches the others after one channel
   round-trip (the commander is the single writer of the master and pushes to
   every replica; a late worker is seeded at announce). It is eventual, not
   synchronous — which suits the real uses (cache-invalidation timestamps, flags).
   Per-user and per-page state is pinned to one worker and immediately coherent
   there.

Does it need genropy at build time?
   No. genropy is a **runtime** requirement (the worker runs a ``GnrWsgiSite``).
   The package imports ``gnr.*`` only at runtime. Its only Python build dependency
   is ``kajenn``.

Can I add other apps beside the site?
   Yes. The server is multi-app: mount a REST/OpenAPI surface, an MCP endpoint, or
   a native async app beside the site, each on its own path prefix, all on the same
   origin and the same genropy database. Because it is one origin, a legacy page can
   reach a new endpoint directly (shared cookies, no CORS). See :doc:`composition`.

Where do I see what the pool is doing?
   ``GET /_server/monitor_state`` returns a JSON snapshot: per worker its status
   and occupancy (the metric the pool decides on), its user/connection/page counts
   for context, and the commander's site-wide surface totals. For a live view open
   ``/_server/monitor`` in a browser (a dashboard kajenn provides natively);
   for Prometheus, scrape ``/metrics`` on the commander.
