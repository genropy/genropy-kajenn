Add more apps beside the site
=============================

Serve a REST/OpenAPI surface, an MCP endpoint, or a native async app next to the
legacy site — on one port, one origin, sharing the same genropy database and the
same session cookie. This page gives you the recipes.

Pick a growth pattern
---------------------

There are **two ways** to grow native ASGI surface next to the site:

* **Beside** — mount separate apps, each on its own path prefix (``/api/``,
  ``/mcp/``, …). The site keeps ``/``; the new apps live under paths it never used.
* **In place** — add native routes to the host application itself, replacing
  individual site paths one at a time (a ``/sys/health`` served natively while the
  rest of ``/sys/*`` stays legacy). This is the incremental-migration path.

Both share the same foundation: a **multi-app ASGI server** — one process, one
port, **one origin** — where every app can talk to the *same genropy database* the
site uses. The typical *beside* shape:

* ``/`` — the legacy ``GnrWsgiSite`` (the UI),
* ``/api/`` — a REST/OpenAPI surface,
* ``/mcp/`` — an MCP endpoint for AI agents,
* ``/live/`` — a native async app of your own.

Add a REST / OpenAPI API on the site's database
-----------------------------------------------

``GenropyProxyOpenApiApplication`` (from ``genropy_kajenn.proxy``) hosts a
``GnrApp`` behind an ``OpenApiApplication``. Your routing class exposes plain
methods as REST; the mixin closes the db connection on the executor thread after
each call. Point it at the same instance the site serves — same database,
different surface:

.. code-block:: python

   from genropy_kajenn.proxy import GenropyProxyOpenApiApplication

   api = GenropyProxyOpenApiApplication(
       instance="mysite",        # the same genropy instance the site serves
       routing_class=MyApi(),    # your @route-decorated methods
       docs="swagger",           # swagger | redoc | off
   )
   server.mount("api", api)      # → now on /api/

Reuse the same class as MCP
---------------------------

Expose the same routing class as an **MCP** endpoint with
``McpOpenApiApplication`` (from ``kajenn.applications.openapi_application``):
the MCP engine points at the same router, so one set of methods serves both a REST
client and an AI agent — no second implementation.

.. code-block:: python

   from kajenn.applications.openapi_application import McpOpenApiApplication

   server.mount("mcp", McpOpenApiApplication(routing_class=MyApi(), api_name="tools"))
   # → now on /mcp/

Replace site paths one at a time (in place)
-------------------------------------------

The *beside* apps above live under their own prefixes. The **in-place** pattern is
different: it adds native routes to the host application itself, on paths the site
already owns, and lets them shadow the legacy handler **one path at a time** — the
native surface grows while the site keeps serving everything not yet moved, with no
second deployment and no cut-over.

Subclass the host application and add the route:

.. code-block:: python

   from kajenn import route
   from genropy_kajenn.spa import GenropySpaApplication

   class MySite(GenropySpaApplication):
       @route(media_type="application/json")
       def sys_health(self):        # /sys/health is now native…
           return {"status": "ok"}
       # …/sys/customer, /sys/order, … still render on the legacy site.

Then point ``app_class`` at ``MySite`` in the config recipe (the same seam the
built-in ``GenropySpaApplication`` uses for ``/metrics``). Migrate the
stateless service paths first (health, metrics, small JSON APIs); paths that need
the legacy page context — session, avatar, rendered state — are the last to move.

.. note::

   This is the shape of the classic *strangler fig* migration (Martin Fowler): the
   new system grows around the old and replaces it gradually, with a working system
   at every step. Nothing forces you to do this — it is simply what the two-stage
   demux makes possible when you want it. The host demultiplexes in two stages: the
   first path segment selects an internal root, then the full path is resolved in
   the app's own router; a structural miss inside a claimed root falls through to
   the site. Claiming a root therefore does *not* claim its whole subtree — a single
   native ``@route`` shadows exactly its own path.

Embed a new endpoint from a legacy page
---------------------------------------

Because every app lives under one host and port, the browser sees **one origin**:
no CORS to configure, and the legacy session cookie is sent to every path. A
legacy genropy page can therefore reach a new ASGI endpoint directly — with the
user's session already authenticated:

* ``fetch("/api/…")`` from page code, or
* ``<iframe src="/live/…">`` embedding a modern async view inside the classic UI.

New surfaces grow next to the old pages without a second deployment, a second
domain, or a token exchange.

.. note::

   "Same origin" is what makes embedding *easy* (shared cookies, no CORS) — the
   framework does not inject ASGI markup into legacy pages for you. You embed from
   the legacy side (a ``fetch``, an ``iframe``, a script tag) pointing at the
   mounted path.

Mount the extra apps in a pool
------------------------------

In a pool, mount the extra apps on the **same server as the front**. The front
forwards only the site's own traffic to the workers (every path whose first
segment is not one of its own **internal roots**); apps mounted beside it are
served locally, in the front's process. Each keeps its own ``GnrApp`` and closes
its db connection on the right thread — independent of the workers hosting the site.
