"""Contract: recording and replay preserve a session across distinct HTTP targets.

A real local WSGI server records both sessions. The replay must learn the new
page identifier and cookie, preserve repeated form fields and opaque bodies,
and correlate each replayed request with its source exchange. No genropy site
or historical dataset is required; source parity is supplied for these two
instances of the same test application.
