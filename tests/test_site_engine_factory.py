"""Contract tests for the group engine: what the template hands its children.

The fork path (core contract, 2026-08-24): a template process builds the
``GnrWsgiSite`` once through :class:`GenropySiteEngineFactory` and forks a
worker off it, so the site travels by inheritance instead of being rebuilt.
What is asserted here is what a forked child depends on:

- the engine comes back settled, with the two lazy resolutions the first
  request would otherwise force in every worker already done;
- no db connection is left open, because a socket inherited by every child is
  a socket every child would speak on;
- no thread is started, because the template refuses to fork when more than
  one is alive;
- a worker handed a ``group_engine`` hosts THAT site and builds none of its
  own, while a worker without one still builds its site as it always did.

Real site, no stubs: what these tests protect is the behaviour of the real
``GnrWsgiSite`` under fork, and a stub would assert nothing about it.
