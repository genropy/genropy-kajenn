"""One live lane for the tests: a GenropyWorker, its real handler, a real desk.

The new core routes every ``collect_page`` (and every store call) through the
commander's delivery desk, so a bare worker cannot serve the register pull:
the tests that drive the client need the FULL protocol. This helper is the
bridge's transcription of the core's own test convention
(kajenn ``tests/orchestration/conftest.py``, ``XT_DeskLane``): a real
``GenropySpaCommander`` (the desk is the bridge's, #59) with one ``GroupHandler``, a real ``WorkerHandler`` bound on
a UDS, and the ``GenropyWorker`` — hosting the real site — presented on it.
Nothing is stubbed; the only thing missing is the commander's beat, which no
register scenario needs.

The lane owns an event loop on a background thread, so plain synchronous
tests keep calling the client from the pytest thread exactly as the site's
WSGI threads do in production: the worker's ``run_on_loop`` hops onto the
lane's loop by itself.
