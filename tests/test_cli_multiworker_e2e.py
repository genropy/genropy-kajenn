"""End-to-end: ``gnrkajenn`` — the pool booted by the CLI, driven over HTTP.

The bridge from the outside: the CLI boots a ``GenropySpaApplication`` whose
recipe-born commander (``SpaCommander``) spawns the reception worker hosting
the genropy site; the test talks HTTP only. There is no worker count to pass
— the pool always runs and sizes itself. No register daemon anywhere.

Covers: the recipe's pool shape, the worker spawn, the sticky forward (page served
by the child through the commander), the child's LOCAL drain of the ping envelope,
and the commander's native ``/metrics`` surface reflecting the guest lifecycle.

Readiness is probed on ``/metrics`` (served natively by the commander process, so
it answers as soon as the front is up) and then on ``/`` (which forwards, so it
answers 200 only once the child hosts the site).
