"""End-to-end datachange scenarios against a real GnrWsgiSite on the NEW single.

These REQUIRE genropy and the ``test_invoice_pg`` site; they skip cleanly when
either is missing. No register daemon anywhere: the front is
``GenropySpaApplication`` (the core ``SpaApplication``) attached to the live
lane of ``tests/lane.py`` — the GenropyWorker with its real handler and a real
commander desk, all in this process so the register and the db stay
inspectable — and every request crosses the demux, the ``http`` CALL forward,
the real wire and the WSGI seam.

The asserts encode the register semantics the daemon rail established: the same
scenarios stayed green across daemon -> daemonless -> core rebase — this suite
is the golden reference, not a byte-compare. The envelope keeps the daemon's
contract whole: only the explicitly written leaves travel (the autocreated
parents the legacy capture records stay internal), each with its ``fired``
flag verbatim, delivered once — the drain is destructive.

Scenario coverage:
- page open -> the site's connection cookie AND the routing cookie, both
  carrying the SAME connection id,
  ``page_id`` in the bootstrap HTML
- ping -> empty envelope when no changes are pending
- subscribeTable + notifyDbEvents -> delivered once on ping (collect is
  destructive), origin page NOT excluded (legacy semantics)
- real db write -> commit -> onDbCommitted -> notifyDbEvents -> delivered on ping
- user-store: setStoreSubscription + userStore().set_datachange -> the leaf
  change delivered on the first pull, nothing on later pulls (destructive drain)
- second tab (same user): the user change reaches it too, once each
- pageStore().set_datachange (the batch/thermo write) -> delivered on ping
- chat (the ct_send_message replay): the fired write reaches sender AND
  recipient with ``fired=True`` and only the written leaf in the envelope
