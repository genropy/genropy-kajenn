"""GenropyRegisterClient — the in-process register for legacy genropy, on the core worker.

The genropy ``GnrWsgiSite`` talks to a register through ``site.register``, calling one
command at a time while it serves a request. Historically that register was a daemon
(Pyro4, then the genro-nodaemon TCP daemon); here it is the DAEMONLESS register,
standalone, and every command the legacy calls is an EXPLICIT public method with its
own body and a docstring saying who calls it and when. No ``__getattr__`` magic, no
per-string dispatch table: what the register serves is exactly the set of methods below.

The register reaches its worker as ``site.spa_worker`` — a
:class:`~genropy_kajenn.spa.genropy_worker.GenropyWorker`, the core ``UserStickyWorker``
hosting this very site — and calls its op methods DIRECTLY: the ops are sync, take
``dispatch_lock``, and the call runs on the worker's http_pool thread, where the CALL
sinks are open by context copy. There is no fold, no event sink read from the environ:
the op itself announces what it did on the CALL that caused it.

Who serves what (FIXED):
- Lifecycle — ``new_connection``/``new_page``/``change_connection_user``/``drop_page``/
  ``drop_connection`` call the worker's homonymous ops. LOGIN STAYS: the login is a
  local re-label on the live connection row (core 0.29) — nothing ships, and the WSGI
  request keeps finding its pages on this worker to the end.
- Reads — answered from the worker's registers directly (``page_items.get`` etc.);
  the ``_filter_items`` grammar stays client-local (the single sees everything).
- Datachanges — ``set_datachange``/``setInClientData`` build the genro-bag change dict
  and call ``worker.set_datachange`` with the TYTX-encoded parcel; a page address is a
  SIGNAL deposit on that page's collector, ``register_name='user'`` is a STATE write on
  the user's live store, found by every subscribed page in its own ``user_view``.
  ``subscribeTable``/``notifyDbEvents``/``setStoreSubscription`` map to the homonymous
  ops (``client_path`` becomes ``prefix``).
- The pull — ``subscription_storechanges``/``handle_ping`` drain via
  ``worker.collect_page`` and rebuild the legacy envelope. The ``dbevents`` species is
  DRESSED at delivery as datachanges on ``gnr.dbchanges.<table>``: the disguise is the
  bridge's, at the envelope — the core keeps the species separate.
- Stores — each row's ``data`` IS its live ``store`` (one legacy Bag, the object the
  collectors watch and a move would package); ``ServerStore`` locks the item and
  reads/writes it in-process. The legacy ``data`` seed of ``new_page`` becomes the
  page's store, so channel-A writes, the dbenv walk and the capture all see one Bag.
- Global store — the ONLY copy lives on the commander, as ONE DICTIONARY behind
  one FIFO lock (owner design 2026-08-21, genropy/genro-asgi#74). Every access is a CALL,
  and :class:`~genropy_kajenn.siteregister.global_store_adapter.GlobalStoreAdapter`
  is the whole surface: the FIRST segment of a legacy path is the dictionary key,
  the rest of the path lives inside the legacy Bag stored under it. A subpath
  write or delete holds a keyed read-modify-write turn (a sibling leaf another
  worker wrote must not be lost); a ``with globalStore()`` block holds the whole
  dictionary for its thread and publishes it once, on the exit.

NOT served (explicit, PROVISIONAL): dump/load (future Service Store),
sendProcessCommand/pendingProcessCommands (inter-process bus, will move to the
commander), the daemon-only admin browser. They answer as documented no-ops.

Wiring: this class IS the ``SiteRegisterClient`` the legacy imports as
``gnr.web.daemon.siteregister_client`` (the ``siteregister`` submodule provides the
``gnr.web:daemon`` entry-point), so the ``GnrWsgiSite`` builds it directly at
``site.register`` — no daemon connection at construction, no rebind. Extra state is
created lazily through ``__dict__`` (the site touches ``self.register`` before the
worker has attached itself via ``site.spa_worker``).

        so nothing the core keeps for itself leaks to the site and nothing the
        daemon guaranteed is missing. Both directions were divergences the
        replica measured on the first bridge cycle (2026-08-25): the connection
        register item carried five core fields the daemon never had and lacked
        five the daemon always had, and the page register item diverged the same
        way two calls later.

        The live objects stay the same objects — the data Bag, the ``pages`` and
        ``connections`` edge sets — and the core's own register item is never
        touched: the expiry sweep keeps reading its clocks as floats where they
        are.

        What the projection adds on top of the field list:

        - **The three queue fields** the daemon put on every register item
          (``addRegisterItem``, siteregister.py:135). ``subscribed_paths`` is the
          page register item's own set, cheap to read. ``datachanges`` and
          ``datachanges_idx`` go out as the empty shape: on this stack the queue
          is not on the register item but in the page's collectors, and the
          surface that reads it is ``ServerStore.datachanges``, which drains them
          there. The bridge also numbers each change and not each register item,
          so there is no per-item counter to answer with.
        - **``register_name``**, which the daemon seeded on the register item
          itself.
        - **``user`` on a PAGE register item.** The daemon stored it; here
          ownership is derived through the connection (``_page_owner``,
          cemented) — so the key the legacy reads is answered, and still nothing
          is stored.
        - **``user`` on a USER register item.** The daemon seeded ``user=user``
          (siteregister.py:319-323) and the chat keys its rooms on that attribute
          (``prepare_usersbag``, chat_component.js:180 — ``setItem(n.attr.user,
          ...)``, which crashes the client Bag on undefined). The core keys the
          entry by name instead of storing it, so the answer restores the field.
        - **``subscribed_tables``**, the daemon's name for what the core register
          item carries as ``table_subscriptions``.
        - **``start_ts``**, read unconditionally as the "no client clock reported
          yet" fallback (connection.py:196) and as a page's birth instant
          (gnrasync.py:379). The connection and page register items are born with
          it (the lifecycle commands stamp it); a USER entry is created by the
          core itself, implicitly, under a new connection, so it cannot be
          stamped from here and falls back to the item's server clock — the
          creation instant, converted out of the core's epoch float.
