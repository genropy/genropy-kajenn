"""GlobalStoreAdapter — the legacy dotted path onto the commander's one dictionary.

The commander owns ``dict[str, Any]`` (genropy/genro-asgi#74): literal string keys — a
dot in a key is a character, never a path — opaque values, one FIFO lock, and no
replica anywhere. The legacy site instead speaks dotted paths on a Bag
(``CACHE_TS.invoices``, ``tables_user_conf_expire_ts``, ``RESTART_TS``). This
class is the ONLY place where the two meet:

- ``split_global_path`` takes the FIRST path segment as the dictionary key; the
  rest of the path is read and written INSIDE the legacy Bag stored under that
  key, here in the worker. The commander never sees a path, and the leaves are
  never flattened into keys.
- the intended shape is ``{"CACHE_TS": Bag, "globalServices_lastChangedConfigTS":
  Bag, "tables_user_conf_expire_ts": Bag, "RESTART_TS": datetime, "TASK_TS":
  datetime}``: a whole-key write is one ``set``, a subpath write is one keyed
  ``for_update`` turn.

**A subpath is never read normally and written back.** Between the read and the
write another worker may have written a sibling leaf, and the overwrite would
drop it: every subpath write and every subpath delete holds a keyed turn for
the whole read-modify-write. A delete under an ABSENT key aborts its turn — a
normal exit would publish the key as ``None``, which is not the same as absent.

**A ``with globalStore()`` block holds the WHOLE dictionary.** ``open_turn``
enters one ``for_update()`` with no key and keeps the lease in
``_active_global_turn``, a thread-local: every operation of that thread then
works on the private dictionary copy and its contained legacy Bags, and the
exit publishes the whole thing at once (or, on a body that raised, nothing).
The lease is never captured by a caller: a facade resolves the thread's state
on every single operation, so a second ``globalStore()`` obtained inside the
block finds the same turn, and one kept across the exit reaches the master
again. A nested block is refused by the core, whose ``RuntimeError`` travels
out untouched.

**Before the worker attaches** (the site touches its register while it is being
built) a local legacy Bag answers reads and writes. It is local only and is
never uploaded: after the attach the commander alone answers.

**The legacy date boundary, both ways.** The legacy world writes and compares
naive LOCAL clocks; the wire (TYTX) reads a naive datetime as UTC. So a naive
scalar handed to the wire as it is would come back shifted by the local offset.
On the way IN (``wire_value``) a naive datetime gets the local zone attached,
its clock preserved — 12:00 naive becomes 12:00 with the local tzinfo — on every
road to the master: the scalar ``set``, a value written into a turn's private
dictionary, and the whole dictionary a turn republishes. On the way OUT
(``legacy_value``) aware becomes naive local, naive is left alone, and the
leaves of a returned Bag are walked. The same walk is what makes the value a
private copy: nothing the site mutates afterwards reaches the store. A date
INSIDE a legacy Bag needs neither: its typed XML carries the local offset.
