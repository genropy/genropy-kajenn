"""The ``gnr.web.daemon.siteregister`` face of the in-process register.

The legacy imports a handful of names from ``gnr.web.daemon.siteregister``
(``DEFAULT_PAGE_MAX_AGE``, ``GnrDaemonException``) and its backward-compat shim
re-exports ``RegisterResolver`` from here too. This module provides exactly those,
with no daemon server behind them: the register lives inside the SPA application, not
in a separate ``GnrSiteRegister`` process.
