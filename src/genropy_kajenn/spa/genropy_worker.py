"""GenropyWorker: the core ``SpaWorker`` hosting a ``GnrWsgiSite``.

The execution unit of the genropy bridge. The core worker owns the site
verbs, the registers and the lane to its commander; this subclass adds
exactly the legacy site:

- the constructor takes ``source`` (a site name or a site directory path)
  and ``debug``, builds the ``GnrWsgiSite`` (the Werkzeug debugger wrapper
  when ``debugger``, ``site._local_mode = True``, atexit ``on_site_stop``) and
  assigns the possibly-wrapped site to ``self.wsgi_app`` — the core's
  consumer seam for the http CALL form;
- the site's lazy per-process state is settled right after creation,
  single-threaded (``site.resources_dirs``; ``site.storage("gnr")`` —
  genropy#984): the first concurrent request must not race the resource
  scan;
- the idle valve follows the site: unless the caller named
  ``user_idle_freeze_minutes``, it is read from the site's ``<cleanup>``
  section as ``connection_max_age`` seconds (the one legacy age with an
  equivalent — the silence past which the legacy register dropped a logged
  connection, and this worker parks the user in the freezer instead);
  ``page_max_age`` and ``guest_max_age`` have no equivalent on this base: a
  silent tab's row lives until the site drops it or its user freezes, and a
  guest is distinguished only at the commander's frozen expiry;
- ``site.spa_worker = self`` (the ratified name) is how the in-process
  register client reaches the worker's site verbs, and the client itself is
  captured at construction (the site's lazy ``register`` property does
  db-touching work that must not run on the event loop);
- the client reads ``user_items``/``connection_items``/``page_items``:
  translating properties over the core's ``*_register`` names (decision
  §7a, 2026-08-20 — the core keeps its names, the bridge translates);
- ``drop_page`` keeps the legacy ``cascade`` flag and absorbs it (decision
  D7, 2026-08-20): the core demolition — drop the page, and the connection
  and user its departure empties — is the sanctioned semantics;
- the three drop verbs remove the connection folders under
  ``data/_connections`` together with the rows. Freeze and transfer use the
  registry's internal removers and are deliberately not hooked: a frozen or
  moved user's folders must survive for the wake. A frozen user the
  commander expires leaves folders behind — the declared debt that replaces
  the retired orphan sweep;
- ``build_registry()`` returns :class:`~genropy_kajenn.spa.genropy_register.GenropyRegistry`:
  the site's page row (:class:`~genropy_kajenn.spa.genropy_register.GenropyPageRow`)
  and legacy Bag stores under :class:`~genropy_kajenn.spa.legacy_bag.LegacyBagCollector`
  capture — the registry module says how;
- ``exit_process()`` stops the site (``on_site_stop``) before the core
  teardown.
- the site's verbs of the data plane (genropy/genro-asgi#59: they left the core and
  live here): ``setStoreSubscription``, ``subscribeTable``, ``notifyDbEvents``,
  ``set_datachange``, ``reset_datachanges``, ``drop_datachanges``,
  ``collect_page`` — the register client calls them by name on
  ``site.spa_worker``. An addressed write to a page of the caller's own user
  living here lands on the row at once; every other address climbs to the desk
  as ONE CALL on ``/commander/delivery/on_datachange``; a subscription is
  filed at the desk synchronously; a commit's deposits accumulate on the
  request's own slot (:class:`GenropyRequestSlot`) and leave at its end — in
  ``collect_page``'s exchange, or alone through ``deliver_slot_deposits`` from
  ``on_request_served``. ``subscribed_tables`` is the source filter the desk
  pushes down on ``/commander/delivery/subscribed_tables``
  (:class:`DeliveryOrders`); ``_install_carried_store`` re-attaches the
  ``user_view`` of every watching page on the carried Bag.

This module imports ``gnr.*`` at the top BY DESIGN (via ``genropy_register``):
it is loaded through the ``worker_class`` dotted path only where genropy
is installed.

        the same pieces: the registry drop and the announcement.
        ``cascade=True`` is the core drop itself: the page, and the
        connection and user its departure empties. Either way the disk
        follows the rows: the whole connection folder when the connection
