"""GenropyRegistry and GenropyPageRow: the core registry carrying the site's page row.

The core registry knows three rows and a store factory; what a genropy page
queues, subscribes and watches is the bridge's to add (genropy/genro-asgi#59, block
4). This module adds exactly that:

:class:`GenropyPageRow` is the core ``PageRow`` with the fields of a hosted
page:

- ``datachanges`` / ``datachanges_idx``: the row's own queue of changes bound
  for the browser and the index stamped on the last one;
- ``user_view``: ``None`` until the first ``subscribe_store_path``, then the
  collector that watches the owner user's store for the page — a live object
  bound to a Bag of this process, so the parcel leaves it behind and the wake
  rebuilds it from ``store_subscriptions``;
- ``subscribed_paths``: the prefixes of the page's OWN store the capture
  queues writes under;
- ``store_subscriptions``: the prefixes of the USER store the view watches;
- ``table_subscriptions``: the tables the page subscribes — what the birth
  announces to the vertex, which rebuilds its table index from it.

The three sets travel in the parcel and are replayed on the woken row, so a
page wakes capturing what it captured before it went to the deposit. The
row has no ``dbevents`` field: nothing writes one — a db event reaches the
page through the vertex's desk and the request slot, never through the row.

:class:`GenropyRegistry` names the row (``page_row_class``) and overrides the
core seams that touch a Bag's API, and nothing else: ``new_store()`` returns a
legacy ``gnr.core.gnrbag.Bag``, ``new_collector(store, paths)`` returns a
``LegacyBagCollector``, and ``subscribe_page_store``/``detach_page`` attach and
remove the row-queue capture with the legacy ``subscribe(id, any=...)`` (no
``transaction`` kind exists there) — every row of the chain (user stores,
page stores, the views) is a legacy Bag, so legacy values ride the registers
untranslated (cemented rule B1). A legacy store travels a move pickled whole:
the legacy Bag drops its subscribers at ``__getstate__``, and the registry
re-attaches the capture on arrival.

The queue and the view are the registry's too: ``append_page_datachange`` is
the ONE append to a page row's queue (the store capture and the addressed
write share it, so the row has one list and one index);
``subscribe_store_path`` opens or widens the page's ``user_view``; and
``change_connection_user`` re-attaches every view of the moved connection's
pages on the NEW owner's store after the core has re-labelled the connection —
the old collector is detached, a new one is created with the very same
``store_subscriptions`` prefixes and re-deposited with everything the old one
still held, never drained. The guest-transfer path of the core keeps the very
same store object, so its views need no re-attaching and get none.

This module imports ``gnr.*`` at the top BY DESIGN (via ``legacy_bag``): it is
loaded through the worker only where genropy is installed.
