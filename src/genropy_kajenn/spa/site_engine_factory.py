"""GenropySiteEngineFactory: the one construction of the ``GnrWsgiSite``.

The bridge's side of the fork contract (core, 2026-08-24). The core lets a
group build ONE expensive object — the ``group_engine`` — in a template
process, and forks its workers from there; the engine the bridge hands over
is the ``GnrWsgiSite``. The core never opens it: it resolves this class from
the template payload's ``engine_factory``, instantiates it with the
payload's ``kwargs``, and calls ``build_group_engine()``.

The same construction serves both births: ``GenropyWorker`` builds its own
site through this factory when it is spawned, and receives an already-built
one when it is forked. One code path, so the two workers cannot diverge.

Three duties belong to this class and to no one else:

- **the site is settled before the fork** — ``resources_dirs`` and
  ``storage("gnr")``, the two lazy resolutions the first request would
  otherwise force in every worker, at 46.5 MB of privatized pages each;
- **the db connection is closed before the fork** (``site.db.closeConnection()``,
  which closes the connections of the calling thread). A socket inherited by
  every child is a socket every child would speak on;
- **one thread must be alive when the engine is returned**. The template
  refuses to fork when ``threading.active_count() != 1``, so anything the
  site starts during construction — a package hook, a storage service —
  stops the whole group from growing. The count is not enforced here; it is
  verified by the template, and this is where a violation originates.

The ``gnr`` imports stay inside the method, transcribed from the worker this
code was moved out of: the module must stay importable where the site
machinery cannot load.
