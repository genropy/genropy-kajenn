"""GenropySpaApplication — the genropy front on the core ``SpaApplication``.

The core front owns the whole serving machinery: the pool born from the
recipe at startup (``SpaCommander`` and its groups), the two-stage demux
(native routes vs the hosted site), the ``spa_connection_id`` routing
cookie — the connection id the site itself creates, no mint — and the
``http`` CALL forward. The pool is not configured here: its words live in
the recipe, under ``applications.<code>.commander`` — see
``genropy_kajenn.spa.config`` for the recipe this package ships. This
subclass adds exactly the genropy fit:

- the ROOT mount, declared as the class attribute the core reads
  (``mount = ""``): a genropy site builds absolute URLs, so a prefix would
  serve the first page and 404 every path that page asks for. A non-empty
  ``mount`` kwarg is refused at construction rather than silently obeyed;
- the startup check that every group's ``worker_kwargs`` names a
  ``source``: a pool of workers that host no site would come up and refuse
  every request, so the recipe defect is said at boot, not discovered in
  the log of the first child;
- ``/metrics``: the Prometheus exposition served natively by the demux.
  ``genropy_site_counters`` keeps the legacy MEANING — the three population
  counters (users, pages, connections), read from the commander's own
  indexes — and the commander's aggregate event counters are exposed as
  additional ``genropy_site_events`` lines. Nothing an existing scrape read
  disappears.
