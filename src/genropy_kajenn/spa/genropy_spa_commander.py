"""GenropySpaCommander: the core's vertex with the desk of a hosted genropy site.

The core commander knows populations, placements, the global store and the
freezer; what a genropy site adds at the vertex — who subscribes which table,
what waits for which page — left the core with genropy/genro-asgi#59 and lives here,
attached through the seams the core names for a consumer:

- ``commander_dispatcher.add_branches``: the :class:`~genropy_kajenn.spa.
  delivery_desk.DeliveryDesk` is the ``delivery`` branch, so a worker's CALLs
  on ``/commander/delivery/{subscribe_table,exchange,deposit,on_datachange}``
  resolve to its routes, the paths the core had;
- ``envelope_handler`` (a property): :class:`GenropyCommanderEnvelopeHandler`
  is the last layer of the envelope chain — its ``on_new_page`` reads the
  ``table_subscriptions`` a page's birth (or wake) announces and hands them to
  ``record_page_table_subscriptions``, so the desk's index is a projection of
  the page rows, rebuilt from every announcement;
- ``on_worker_presented``: a newborn worker is sent the source filter (the
  desk's whole table set) on a task of its own, never holding up the envelope;
- ``drop_page`` / ``drop_connection`` / ``drop_user``: the core demolition,
  then the desk forgets the departed pages' queues and subscriptions and the
  departed user's store queue.

``broadcast_subscribed_tables`` is what the desk calls on every transition of
the global table set (a table gaining its first subscriber, or losing its
last): one push per living worker, awaited by nobody. The push is the order
``/commander/delivery/subscribed_tables`` on the worker's dispatcher — the
``delivery`` branch the worker attaches to its ``commander_orders`` — with
``{"tables": [...]}``; a worker whose wire is gone or that does not answer in
``SUBSCRIBED_TABLES_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` is logged at debug level and left
alone: the next transition carries the whole set again.

``get_pool_census`` adds the desk's numbers under ``delivery_desk``.

This module imports no ``gnr.*``: it runs in the front process.
