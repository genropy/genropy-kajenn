"""Legacy-Bag capture and the ``::BAG`` wire type for the genropy bridge.

Two pieces, one module:

- ``LegacyBagCollector`` — the datachange capture attached to a legacy
  ``gnr.core.gnrbag.Bag``, implementing the collector contract the core
  registry and worker consume (genro-bag 0.22 dropped its own collector; the
  contract lives here): ``drain(reset=True)``, ``append(change, replace=False)``,
  ``reset()``, ``drop(prefix)``, ``subscribe_path``/``unsubscribe_path``,
  ``detach()``, the ``changes`` list and the ``pending`` count. A change is
  genro-bag's plain dict — ``{key: {path, reason, fired}, value, attributes,
  delete, change_ts (aware UTC), change_idx}`` — so a change born on a
  legacy store travels the same machinery as one born on a core store.

- the ``::BAG`` wire type — importing this module registers the legacy Bag
  with genro-tytx under the code ``BAG``, the legacy's own historical
  datatype code: serialized as its typed XML (``toXml(catalog=...)``),
  parsed back with ``Bag(text)``. The new ``genro_bag.Bag`` keeps ``::X``;
  the two types are NEVER converted into each other.

Capture subscribes the legacy Bag with ``subscribe(id, any=callback)`` — the
legacy trigger vocabulary: an update event's ``pathlist`` already ends with
the node's label, an ``ins``/``del`` event's does not, so the full path is
rebuilt with the label there. Prefixes match on segment boundaries (``a.b``
captures ``a.b.c``, never ``a.bc``); ``paths=None`` captures everything, an
empty set captures nothing. The legacy Bag has no transaction rail, so the
three plain events are the whole capture surface.

The legacy ``setItem`` has no ``_fired`` parameter (the core Bag's
``set_item(_fired=...)`` hands the flag to its trigger natively), so a fired
write announces itself with the transient ``_fired`` node attribute: the
writer (``apply_forwarded``) sets it for the write and removes it right
after. ``_on_event`` pops ``_fired`` from its LOCAL attribute copy — the node
is untouched, so every collector on the Bag sees the flag — and stamps it on
the change. Writes without the attribute carry ``fired=False``; a consumer
forwarding a fire event still supplies ``fired=True`` on the change it
appends.

``append`` deposits a shallow copy and assigns ``change_idx`` to that copy
only — the caller's dict is never mutated, so one change can be forwarded to
any number of collectors. With ``replace=True`` the pending change carrying
an equal ``key`` is removed first: the coalesced change gets a fresh
``change_idx`` and goes to the tail. ``detach()`` stops capture and leaves
the pending list untouched.

This module imports ``gnr.*`` at the top BY DESIGN: it exists only where
genropy is installed, and the ``::BAG`` registration must happen at import.
