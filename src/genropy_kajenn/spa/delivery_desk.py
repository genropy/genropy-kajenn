"""DeliveryDesk: the vertex's desk — who subscribes what, and what waits for whom.

The ``delivery`` branch of the commander's dispatcher: its four ``@route``
methods are the CALLs a worker places on ``/commander/delivery/<op>``, resolved
by name by genro-routes. This is the genropy half of the vertex: it left the
core with genropy/genro-asgi#59 and :class:`~genropy_kajenn.spa.genropy_spa_commander.
GenropySpaCommander` attaches it in the core's place, under the same paths.

The commander alone holds the subscription index and the pending queues, and
every one of them is fed and drained by CALLs a worker places on the lane.
Three species, never mixed: a page's **datachanges** (explicit writes
addressed at it), a page's **dbevents** (the deposits of a commit on a table
it subscribed), and a user's **store changes** (STATE writes addressed at his
own store, applied to his Bag by whichever of his pages retires them —
usersticky puts them all in one process, and the siblings capture the write
locally on their own ``user_view``).

**Outside the pickled surface, on purpose.** The queues are ephemeral: what
is waiting for a user who goes into the freezer is lost with the websockets
that would have carried it, and nothing here is dumped or restored.

**The subscription is written before the call answers**, so the index here is
right the moment the subscriber is told so. The workers' own source filter is
a copy, refreshed by a CALL the commander pushes on every transition of the
set, so a worker filters with a set at most one CALL's flight out of date:
the accepted risk, measured against the tens of seconds that separate a
page's subscription from its first commit.

**The exchange files first and answers after**, so the caller's own events
come back in the same round; a sibling page's events wait in its own queue
for its own next exchange, since nothing is ever pushed from here.

**Nothing waiting here expires.** A queue lives as long as its page: what a
page has not collected yet is delivered at its next exchange whatever its
age, as the daemon's single list did, and ``drop_page`` is what empties it.
Every queued item is stamped ``arrival_ts``, the wall-clock instant it was
filed here — the same clock the workers stamp their own rows with — so a
collect can merge this queue with the row's in the order one list would
have had.
