"""genropy-kajenn — the bridge between kajenn and legacy genropy.

The generic commander/worker model lives in kajenn core
(``kajenn.applications.multi_worker_application``); this package is the
genropy-specific bridge on top of it. Three submodules, the only ``gnr.*``-aware code:

- ``genropy_kajenn.spa`` — the SPA bridge: ``GenropySpaApplication`` (the front on
  the core ``SpaApplication``) whose pool workers are ``GenropyWorker`` instances
  hosting a legacy ``GnrWsgiSite``, plus the ``gnrkajenn`` CLI and the
  in-process register client.
- ``genropy_kajenn.proxy`` — the OpenAPI bridge: a ``GnrApp`` behind an
  ``OpenApiApplication`` with thread-local db cleanup.
- ``genropy_kajenn.siteregister`` — the daemonless register the legacy imports as
  ``gnr.web.daemon`` (entry-point ``gnr.web:daemon``), replacing the register daemon.
