"""GenropyProxyMixin — a genropy legacy db behind an OpenApiApplication.

An ``OpenApiApplication`` mounts a RoutingClass and exposes it as REST (and, via
``McpOpenApiApplication``, as MCP). When those handlers need the genropy legacy
db, someone must own its lifecycle: the connection is thread-local and must be
closed on the thread that opened it — the executor thread where the handler ran,
not the loop. kajenn provides exactly that hook (``route_cleanup``, run in
the executor thread by ``make_callable``); this mixin fills it.

The mixin instantiates a ``GnrApp`` and exposes it as ``self.gnr_app`` (the only
channel the mounted RoutingClass reads, e.g. through its parent). It overrides
only what it owns — ``route_cleanup`` (close the current thread's connection) —
and never the ``OpenApiApplication`` machinery. Direction of dependency is
genropy-kajenn -> kajenn: this imports ``gnr.*``; kajenn never imports genropy.

Compose it with the base to get a mountable app::

    class GenropyProxyOpenApiApplication(GenropyProxyMixin, OpenApiApplication):
