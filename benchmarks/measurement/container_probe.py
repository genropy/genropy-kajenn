"""What a container is made of, read from the kernel: processes, roles, gauges.

One ``docker exec`` per sample walks ``/proc`` inside the container and reads the
cgroup controllers. The script is transcribed from the one proven in
``worker_sensitivity/worker_probe.py``: a single round trip, because a sample
taken with six round trips is six different instants.

The measure is the same for both stacks; only the NAMING of the processes
differs, and that is the whole job of a role map:

- the bridge has a commander, a template and its pool workers;
- the legacy has the register daemon, the Gunicorn master and its workers.

A role map never changes what is read, only what each process is called. Every
sample carries the full command line as well, so a role assigned wrongly is
visible in the data instead of hidden by it.

PROVISIONAL: the legacy role map distinguishes the Gunicorn master from its
workers by parentage, not by process title. Gunicorn rewrites its title only
when ``setproctitle`` is installed, and the lab image does not install it, so
master and workers share one command line. ``certify`` exists for that reason:
the runner declares the shape it expects and the run stops if the classification
does not produce it.
