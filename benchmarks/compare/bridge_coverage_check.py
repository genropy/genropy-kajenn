"""Coverage and isolation checks for the bridge side of the bench.

The legacy recorder is a wrapper that catches every attribute, so it cannot
miss a command: whatever the client grows, the wrapper records. The bridge
recorder is a mixin over an explicit list of verbs, which CAN silently fall
behind the client it shadows. This is the tripwire for that, in the spirit of
the anti-drift check that already guards the daemon contract — and it also
guards the second copy this side needs: the bench recipe, transcribed from the
one the package ships with two lines changed.

What it asserts:

1. the daemon override is the one in force, so the checks below look at the
   bridge's client and not at the legacy Pyro one;
2. every public command the client declares is recorded, and nothing is
   recorded that the client does not declare;
3. every recorded verb really is an override on the recording client, bound to
   the parent implementation it shadows;
4. the store surface the recorder reads as properties is the store's own;
5. the bench recipe and the shipped recipe build the same document — the whole
   tree, not the pool alone — except for the two recording classes, and the
   engine factory the bench names really is the shipped one with the recording
   client installed;
6. the recorder writes one line for the call the site made and none for the
   calls the client makes on itself, hands back a wrapped store, and names on
   every line the site code that made the call — the mixin's own frames and the
   client's excluded, which on this side is what the legacy wrapper got for
   free by standing outside the client;
7. the debug the run row declares is the debug the recipe actually applies.

No site, no server, no database: a throwaway archive in `temp/` and the real
client on a stub site. It runs on the bridge's own interpreter, where genropy,
kajenn and genropy-kajenn are installed.
