"""Isolation checks for the twin proxy: everything it decides BEFORE the wire.

No stacks, no site, no site database. What can be asserted without them is the
part that decides how a session is compared, and it is exactly the part that is
silent when it is wrong: the instance the bridge serves, the two database
commands, what is dispatched against what is compared, the identifiers rewritten
on the way to the shadow, and the join between the two archives.

The join is asserted against REAL archives — two throwaway `RunArchive` files in
`temp/`, written with the lines the two recorders would write. A join asserted
against hand-made dictionaries proves that the test agrees with itself; written
into the archive and read back through `TraceReader`, it proves the query works
on the shape the recorders actually produce.

What is NOT here, because it needs two live stacks: the launch, the readiness
tokens, the copy actually running, and a divergence met on the wire. Those are
the phase's own run, in the browser.

It runs on the BRIDGE interpreter, with the bench environment, because the proxy
imports genropy to read the instance configuration:

  GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \\
      PYTHONPATH=<pinned genropy>/gnrpy \\
      python benchmarks/compare/twin_proxy_check.py
