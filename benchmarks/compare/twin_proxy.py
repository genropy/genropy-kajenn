"""The twin proxy: the owner browses through it, and BOTH stacks answer.

There is no recorded session here. The owner works in a browser against this
proxy, and every request he makes is performed twice — first on the legacy
stack, then on the bridge. The LEGACY answer is the one the browser receives, so
a fault on the bridge never blocks his work; the bridge is the shadow, and what
it answers is only ever compared, never shown.

**One process owns the whole cycle.** This reverses the rule the earlier phases
worked under, where the database copy and the two launchers were steps run by
hand. With a live proxy the owner drives from a browser in real time, so the
orchestration cannot be a sequence of shell commands: the copy, the two stacks
and the comparison have to be one thing that starts and stops together.

  copy the db -> empty the legacy register -> start its daemon -> start
  gunicorn -> start the bridge -> serve, compare, stop

The legacy stack is TWO processes, and that is why its own register daemon is on
that line: `SiteRegisterClient` reads the daemon's Pyro address out of
`site/sitedaemon.xml` when the site is built, so gunicorn started first would
hold an address nobody answers. The daemon also SAVES its register on stop and
restores it on start, so the two saved pickles are deleted before it goes up —
every comparative run begins from an empty register, and a surviving connection
would keep the browser logged in and leave the login out of the session.

**The two instances.** The command line names the instance the LEGACY serves;
the bridge serves that name plus `_asgi` (`sandbox` -> `sandbox_asgi`, owner
2026-08-25). The `_asgi` twin is configuration only — the same `root.py` and
`siteconfig.xml`, an `instanceconfig.xml` whose `db` node names the COPY, and no
`sitedaemon.xml`. This proxy does not create it: it reads both
`instanceconfig.xml` files for the two database names, and refuses with the
commands to run when the twin is not there.

**The copy is made before either stack starts**, and that order is not a
preference: `createdb -T` needs its template free of connections, and the
template is the very database the legacy stack is about to open.

**Sequence, not parallelism.** The two legs of one request go out one after the
other, never together: run in parallel they contend for CPU and for the
database, and both timings are dirtied. Sequential warms the second, which is
its own bias — either way the timings here are indicative, and the speed verdict
belongs to macro-phase 3, with collection off.

**What is dispatched, and what is compared, are two different questions.**
Everything the browser sends is dispatched to both stacks, statics included: the
bridge must see exactly the traffic the legacy sees, or its state could diverge
for a reason we introduced. Only the comparison is selective — a static carries
the same pair of register calls every time and says nothing, so it is dispatched
and not compared. The consequence is on record: the serving of static assets is
never compared between the two stacks.

**The join between the two archives** is the one `replica.py` already uses, and
it is reached in two steps because the exchange id is minted inside the stack
that serves the request, not by whoever sends it:

- the legacy leg carries `X-Bench-Twin-Request`, this proxy's own ordinal, which
  the HTTP recorder writes into the line like any other request header; the
  proxy then reads back the legacy exchange id belonging to that ordinal;
- the bridge leg carries `X-Bench-Replica-Of` with that legacy exchange id,
  which is exactly what `TraceReader.get_exchange_replaying` and
  `StructuralDiff` already read. Neither module is modified.

**One shadow per browser.** The bridge-side connection, cookie jar and page-id
map are per-browser things, so the proxy keeps one of each per browser: two
windows logged in as two users are two connections on the legacy stack, and a
single jar would make them one on the bridge. Which browser a request came from
is said by the proxy's OWN cookie, `bench_twin`, minted on first sight and
stripped from everything sent onward. The site's session cookie cannot serve:
its value changes at login, because the connection rotates.

**Identifiers.** The bridge mints its own page ids, so the same `IdentityMap` the
replica uses rewrites the tokens of the legacy request into the tokens the bridge
minted, in the query string and in the body alike. Cookies are never forwarded to
the bridge: the browser's jar belongs to the legacy stack, and this proxy keeps a
jar of its own for the shadow. Every OTHER request header is forwarded as it
came — the user agent among them, because the site writes it into the connection
register item, and a missing one would read as a divergence of the stack.

**The bridge's placement ceiling.** `--max-users-per-worker` reaches the recipe
through `KAJENN_WORKER_MAX_USERS`, which `spa/config.py` passes to the group as
`worker_max_users`. Left out, the core's default governs and one worker takes
everybody: two browsers land in the same process and the cross-worker paths —
the register population, the stores, the datachanges between users — are never
exercised. With `1` each user gets a worker of his own. The birth happens inside
the placement since genro-asgi 2682ad7, so the second user waits the moment a
fork costs instead of being answered 503.

**Debug, one flag for two stacks.** genropy keeps two things apart that the
bridge used to weld together: `site.debug` — the SQL time counters, `pageModule`
in the page's bootstrap — and the werkzeug debugger, an error page that evaluates
Python in the process. On the legacy the first comes from the merged siteconfig
and the second only from `serveprod --debug`; on the bridge they now have a
switch each, `debug` and `debugger` (2026-08-26). So this proxy runs both stacks
with debug ON and no debugger, which is the pair that makes the SQL counters
carry real numbers on both sides, and `--fulldebug` adds the debugger to both.
The legacy cannot be talked out of its configured debug from a command line, so
the bridge follows it rather than the other way round.

**The two rules inherited from Phase 7, both binding.** The exchanges before the
first RPC are not compared, each stack finishing its lazy build there and the
bridge doing it in the template whose lines are dropped by construction. And the
`+28%` is not a pending divergence: it was measured with an instrument that could
not attribute a call, so anything of it that reappears here is a new measurement
with attribution, not a continuation of the old figure.

**One call, one verdict, and nothing stops.** Every request carries a mark of its
own — `twin-00042` — which reaches BOTH archives, so the unit of comparison is the
single call: it either agrees on the two stacks or it diverges, on its own merits,
whatever the calls around it did. A divergence is therefore a finding about that
call and no reason to arrest the run: `twin-00043` is asked the same question with
no assumption that one follows from the other (owner, 2026-08-26, replacing the
first-divergence arrest the replica works under — that rule fits a linear replay of
one recorded session, not a live session of several independent users, where the
divergence of one must not end the session of the others).

Each divergence is printed, and written to a numbered file of its own beside the
archives, naming the call and the browser. Both stacks stay up throughout, which
is what makes a divergence investigable while it is fresh; the closing summary
lists every call that diverged.

Run, from the repository root:

  GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \\
      PYTHONPATH=<pinned genropy>/gnrpy \\
      GNR_DAEMON_PROVIDER=genropy-kajenn \\
      PGGSSENCMODE=disable python benchmarks/compare/twin_proxy.py \\
      test_invoice_pg_legacy --run "the invoice session"

Then browse http://127.0.0.1:8097. The environment is the bridge's own, because
this process imports genropy to read the instance configuration and asks
`genropy_parity_check.py` whether the two stacks carry the same source; the
legacy child is started WITHOUT `PYTHONPATH`, so it keeps importing the frozen
copy inside `temp/legacy_venv` as it always has. `GNR_DAEMON_PROVIDER` is the
bridge's own condition and the run refuses without it; the legacy child does not
receive it, because on that stack genropy must keep its own daemon client.
