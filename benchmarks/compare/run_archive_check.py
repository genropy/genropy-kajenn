"""Isolation checks for the run archive: the schema, the run row, the promoted
columns as copies of the JSON, the connection that is never inherited across a
fork, and the join written as a query.

No site, no server, no site database — a throwaway archive in `temp/`.

It runs on the BENCH VENV, like the register check and unlike the HTTP one, and
not because it imports genropy — it does not. Section 5 forks a child out of a
process that has minted the run, which is the legacy shape: the gunicorn master
mints and its workers are forked from it. That shape needs sqlite 3.50.4, which
the bench venv carries, and it dies on sqlite 3.51.0 — measured on the pyenv
python 3.12.9 of this machine, 2026-08-25: SIGSEGV in the child, no exception to
catch and no line written. What poisons the child is the PARENT having opened a
connection at all: not WAL, not the same file, and closing before the fork does
not help. It is also INTERMITTENT — two runs in three — so a single green run
proves nothing. Same family as the libpq/Kerberos segfault that makes
`PGGSSENCMODE=disable` mandatory.

The bridge runs on that newer sqlite and forks its workers too, which is why the
template process there is held to writing nothing at all: `recording_engine_factory.py`.
