# The legacy/bridge comparison bench

Everything needed to bring up the classic (synchronous) genropy stack and record
from it. Later the same two recorders go on the genropy-kajenn bridge, where a
**replica** reproduces a session the owner performed and the run stops at the
first divergence — not an offline diff of two finished traces (owner, 2026-08-23;
macro-phase 2 in the roadmap).

The programme is in `.phased/roadmap.md`: three macro-phases, the first two
about **fidelity**, the third about performance. Fidelity work does not read
timings, so the instrumentation may be as heavy as it needs to be.

`benchmarks/compare/` is versioned. What it records is not: every run writes
into a SQLite archive of its own, **outside the git tree** — see *The run
archive* below.

## What runs where

| Piece | Where | Why separate |
|---|---|---|
| The pinned genropy | `<genropy>/worktrees/bench-baseline/` (detached) | the code both stacks run; the developer's own checkout moves, this does not |
| The bench configuration | `temp/gnr/` | names the pinned trees; never committed — it carries the daemon key and the admin password |
| The venv | `temp/legacy_venv/` | never committed; genropy-kajenn must not enter it |
| The instance | `<genropy>/projects/test_invoice/instances/test_invoice_pg_legacy/` | twin of `test_invoice_pg`, same db, different site name |
| The replica instance | `<genropy>/projects/test_invoice/instances/test_invoice_pg_replica/` | the bridge in a replica cycle: same project, own db `test_invoice_pg_replica`, dropped and recreated at every cycle start because the bridge writes |
| The recorders | `benchmarks/compare/` | versioned; genropy itself is never modified |
| The run archives | `~/genro_bench/runs/` (outside the tree) | whole bodies, the login, the cookies — and this repository is public |
| The bridge | the pyenv interpreter, `genropy_kajenn` + `kajenn` editable; genropy from the pin, through `PYTHONPATH` | the bridge is the software under comparison and is edited at every turn of the loop; genropy under it is not |

`<genropy>` is `~/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy` — the developer's own checkout.

## Bring-up

### 0. The pinned genropy

**The bench declares which genropy it runs, and both stacks read that one.** The
developer's checkout moves: on 2026-08-25 it sat on a branch whose single commit
removes the register read for services not configured in the database — 242 of
the 384 register calls a login makes. The bridge, installed editable, was already
running it; the legacy stack, a frozen copy, was not. A difference like that
reads as a difference between the stacks, which is the one thing this bench must
never confuse.

```bash
git -C ~/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy worktree add --detach worktrees/bench-baseline develop
```

Detached on purpose: a branch would move again. To change the baseline, remove
the worktree and add it back on the commit you want — never `git switch` inside
it.

**The configuration folder of the bench** names the pinned trees, so
`resources/`, `packages/`, `webtools/` and the static trees are pinned too, not
only the `gnr` package. It is a copy of `~/.gnr` with the genropy paths moved:

```bash
cp -R ~/.gnr temp/gnr
# then edit temp/gnr/environment.xml: environment.gnrhome, packages.genropy,
# resources.genropy, webtools.genropy and the two static.js paths point at
# worktrees/bench-baseline. projects.genropy does NOT move: the bench instances
# live in the developer's checkout, untracked, and never travel with a commit.
```

**It must be called `gnr`.** genropy loads the whole folder as one Bag whose top
node is the folder's own name, and every lookup is written `gnr.environment_xml…`.
A folder named otherwise loads without complaint and answers `None` to every
question — measured 2026-08-25 on a folder called `bench_gnr`, where the
sitedaemon died with `TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable`.

Every command of this bench then carries `GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr`, and
every command on the BRIDGE side also carries
`PYTHONPATH=<genropy>/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy`. Nothing global is touched:
the developer's `~/.gnr` and the editable genropy in the pyenv are left exactly
as they were. `PYTHONPATH` wins over the editable install because its finder
appends itself to `sys.meta_path`, so the ordinary path lookup answers first
(measured 2026-08-25).

`genropy_parity_check.py` proves all of this before any comparative run, and
refuses otherwise — see *The replica* below.

### 1. The venv

```bash
uv venv temp/legacy_venv --python 3.12
uv pip install --python temp/legacy_venv/bin/python \
    "$HOME/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy[pgsql]"
```

From the PIN, never from the checkout. Not editable either: an editable install
points at a working tree and forbids isolated trials. The `[pgsql]` extra is **mandatory** — the Postgres
driver (`psycopg2-binary`, `psycopg`) is an optional dependency of genropy, and
without it the site cannot reach the database. `gunicorn` is a base dependency
and needs no extra step.

The site logs `ERROR: missing dependencies: pdf2image, watchdog, pyotp, qrcode`
at boot. These are optional features the bench does not exercise; the message is
noise, not a failure.

### 2. The twin instance

A copy of `test_invoice_pg` under the same project, carrying **configuration
only** — the runtime state (`site/data/`, `site/_static/`) is left out so the
first run starts clean, and the site recreates what it needs:

```bash
SRC=~/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/projects/test_invoice/instances/test_invoice_pg
DST=~/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/projects/test_invoice/instances/test_invoice_pg_legacy
mkdir -p "$DST/site"
cp "$SRC/instanceconfig.xml"  "$DST/instanceconfig.xml"
cp "$SRC/root.py"             "$DST/root.py"
cp "$SRC/site/siteconfig.xml" "$DST/site/siteconfig.xml"
```

`instanceconfig.xml` is copied unchanged: the twin points at the **same**
database, `test_invoice_pg` on postgres localhost:5432. Only the site name
differs, which is enough — the two stacks never collide on site folder or on
the session cookie, which is named after the site (`test_invoice_pg_legacy`).

The resolver finds the instance as `instances/test_invoice_pg_legacy/site`; the
old `sites/` shell no longer exists.

### 3. Hygiene, before every run

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:8098 -iTCP:8099 -iTCP:40004 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Must come back empty. An old server left standing falsifies everything
downstream — and on 40004 it silently prevents the sitedaemon from starting.

**Every run starts from an empty register, and that means restarting the
sitedaemon too, not only gunicorn.** The reason is comparability: on the bridge
a restart wipes the registers unless a soft reset says otherwise, so a legacy
run whose register survived from an earlier session does not start from the same
state and the two runs are not comparable.

Restarting the daemon is not enough by itself: it **saves its status on stop**
(`gnr/web/daemon/siteregister.py:1057`) and **restores it on start** whenever the
pickle is there (`:1087`). The file has to go:

```bash
SITE=~/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/projects/test_invoice/instances/test_invoice_pg_legacy/site
rm -f "$SITE/siteregister_data.pik" "$SITE/siteregister_data_loaded.pik"
```

Nothing to delete on the recording side: each run mints an archive file of its
own, so a run never lands on top of another one's lines.

So the full clean restart is, in order: stop gunicorn, stop the sitedaemon,
delete the pickle, start the sitedaemon, start gunicorn. Gunicorn
last, and always after the daemon: `SiteRegisterClient` reads the Pyro URIs out
of `sitedaemon.xml` when it is built, so a worker started before a new daemon
holds addresses that no longer answer.

**A surviving register keeps you logged in.** The site cookie carries the user
and the `connection_id`; if the register still knows that connection, the browser
walks straight into the application and the trace contains no login at all. Seen
on 2026-08-23: a session from an earlier run reappeared after a gunicorn-only
restart, because gunicorn holds no session state — the cookie plus the daemon's
register are the whole identity.

### 4. The sitedaemon, in the foreground

```bash
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr PGGSSENCMODE=disable \
    temp/legacy_venv/bin/gnrdaemon test_invoice_pg_legacy
```

With a sitename that command runs the site register server directly and stays in
the foreground. Without one it starts the multi-site daemon, which spawns its
children with multiprocessing and dies on macOS.

It writes `sitedaemon.xml` in the site folder, and that file is how the site
finds its register: `SiteRegisterClient` reads `register_uri` from it.

**It binds port 40004, and nothing in the site config changes that.** The port
comes from `PYRO_PORT` in `gnr/web/daemon/siteregister.py`, because the CLI
passes no port and the fallback chain ends there. The `gnrdaemon` port the site
config reports (40404) is the address of the *multi-site* daemon and is not used
here. The hmac key does come from `~/.gnr/environment.xml`.

### 5. Gunicorn: one process, 16 threads

```bash
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr PGGSSENCMODE=disable \
    temp/legacy_venv/bin/gnr web serveprod test_invoice_pg_legacy \
    -b 127.0.0.1:8099 -w 1 -k gthread --threads 16
```

`PGGSSENCMODE=disable` is mandatory on macOS: libpq negotiating Kerberos in a
forked child segfaults the worker on its first request.

The site answers on `http://127.0.0.1:8099`.

## Declared conditions of a run

Every run declares these, and two runs are only comparable under the same
declaration. From Phase 4 the declaration is not only written here: the launcher
reads it where each condition is true and stores it **as data** in the archive's
own `run` row, so a run carries its conditions with it.

| Condition | Standard value |
|---|---|
| Stack | legacy: standalone sitedaemon + gunicorn |
| Processes / threads | 1 process, 16 threads (`-w 1 -k gthread --threads 16`) |
| Recorders | both, installed by `serve_legacy.py` + the `-c` config; a run with neither uses step 5's plain command |
| Debug | **off** |
| Register at start | **empty** — daemon restarted and `siteregister_data.pik` deleted |
| Database | `test_invoice_pg`, postgres localhost:5432 |
| genropy | 26.08.19.1 (working copy on `develop`, untouched) |
| Python / gunicorn | 3.12.12 / 26.1.0 |

The launcher never assumes any of it: the workers, the threads, the bind and the
debug flag come from the command line it was given, the database from the
instance's own `instanceconfig.xml`, the versions from the installed
distributions, and the bench commit from git.

**Debug, and the two things it used to mean.** Corrected 2026-08-26, when the twin
proxy measured that this section's own premise was false: omitting `--debug` from
the gunicorn command line does NOT put the legacy site out of debug. Without the
flag `serveprod` builds `GnrWsgiSite(instance_name)` with no options, and the site
then reads `wsgi?debug` from its MERGED siteconfig, where the bench's own
`temp/gnr/siteconfig/default.xml` declares `debug="True::B"`. So the legacy was
running in debug all along while the run row said otherwise, and the bridge — which
always passes options — was not.

The two things genropy keeps apart:

- **`site.debug`** — the SQL time counters (`X-GnrSqlTime`, `X-GnrSqlCount` carry
  real numbers instead of zero), `pageModule` in the page's own bootstrap, the
  developer's extras. On the legacy it comes from the configuration; on the bridge
  from `--nodebug`/the recipe.
- **the werkzeug debugger** — an error page carrying a traceback and a console
  that evaluates Python in the process. On the legacy only `serveprod --debug`
  brings it; on the bridge it was welded to `site.debug` until 2026-08-26 and is
  now its own switch, `debugger`, off unless asked.

**The standard run therefore has debug ON and no debugger, on both stacks**, which
is what makes the SQL counters comparable and keeps the werkzeug middleware — which
the bridge answers errors differently under — out of the comparison.
`--fulldebug` on the twin proxy adds the debugger to both stacks at once; on the
legacy it becomes `serveprod --debug`.

**And both configurations are read as the SITE reads them.** `PathResolver`'s own
`get_instanceconfig` and `get_siteconfig` — the same merge `GnrApp` and
`GnrWsgiSite` run at startup: the default of the gnr folder, then any template,
then the instance's own file. Opening the instance's file alone was the defect
behind the debug mismatch, and it would also miss a `db` node declared in the
default, which is where a deployment usually keeps the connection and its
password.

`--debug` does **not** reduce concurrency: it forces `workers=1` (already the
case) and its `threads` override never lands, so 16 threads survive.

## Accounts

`benchmarks/usernames.txt` — 32 accounts, password `a` for all of them.

**The login trap** (a whole session was lost to it once): the identity travels
in TWO places, and rewriting only the first logs every session in as the
captured user.

- `login_checkAvatar` carries flat `user=` / `password=` form fields;
- `login_doLogin` carries them inside the XML Bag in its `login` field
  (`<user>…</user>`, `<password>…</password>`).

`inject_identity()` in `benchmarks/scaling_probe.py` rewrites both.

**Cookies are not scoped by port.** Both stacks live on `127.0.0.1`, so a
browser used against one sends its cookies to the other as well — a legacy trace
recorded in that browser carries the bridge's cookies among the request headers,
and the other way round. When the replica compares the two stacks those are
leftovers of the browser, not divergences between the two implementations. Observed on
2026-08-23: a `sticky_cid` from the bridge arrived on a legacy request.

## The two recorders

- **HTTP recorder** — `http_recorder.py`, a WSGI middleware wrapping the app.
  Built. Writes `http` lines into the run archive.
- **Register recorder** — `register_recorder.py`, a wrapper object standing in
  place of `SiteRegisterClient`, patched by name in the `gnr.web.gnrwsgisite`
  namespace. Built. Writes `register` lines into the same archive, every line
  carrying the `exchange_id` of the exchange that caused the call.

Both are **installed by a plain call**, never by logic living inside a gunicorn
hook: the bridge has no gunicorn, and the same two recorders install there too.
On the legacy stack the register recorder cannot use a hook at all — the site
builds its register client in the master process before the configuration file
is read — so it installs from the launcher `serve_legacy.py`. The bridge has the
same problem one process further out: its workers are born by FORK out of a
template that built the site already, so the register recorder installs in the
template (`recording_engine_factory.py`) and the HTTP recorder in each forked
child (`recording_worker.py`); see **The bridge side** below.

The 16 threads in one process interleave the calls, so every line of both kinds
carries a thread id as well as the `exchange_id`. That is why the two recorders
are designed together.

### The seam between them: a request header

The HTTP recorder mints the `exchange_id` and injects it into the request as the
**`X-Bench-Exchange-Id`** header. The register recorder reads it back through
`site.currentRequest.headers`.

`GnrWsgiSite.currentRequest` is genropy's own per-thread request — a
`ThreadedDict` filled in `dispatcher` (`gnrwsgisite.py:1155`) and cleared at the
end (`:1446`), so it covers the **whole** dispatch, statics and `_ping`
included. `currentPage` would not: it is only set later, at `:1347`, and during
a ping it is still `None`. The register client has the site in hand —
`SiteRegisterClient.__init__(self, site)` stores it.

Three things follow, and they are why the seam is a header and not a
thread-local of ours:

- no global state in the bench code, and no reimplementation of per-thread
  affinity — genropy's own is used;
- the join key is **visible in the archive**, among the recorded request headers:
  the file carries the key it is joined on;
- the two recorders never import each other. They share the name of a header,
  nothing else — which is what makes the pair installable on the bridge.

Register calls made outside any request — service threads, or anything after the
end-of-dispatch cleanup — carry no `exchange_id`. That is information, not a
loss: in the trace they appear as calls belonging to no exchange.

### Running with both recorders

A recorded run replaces the command of step 5 with the launcher, from the
repository root. Step 5's plain command stays valid and is the declared
condition of a run **without** recorders:

```bash
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr PGGSSENCMODE=disable temp/legacy_venv/bin/python \
    benchmarks/compare/serve_legacy.py test_invoice_pg_legacy \
    -b 127.0.0.1:8099 -w 1 -k gthread --threads 16 \
    -c benchmarks/compare/gunicorn_recorders.conf.py
```

Everything after the script is genropy's own `serveprod` command line: the
launcher adds nothing and takes nothing away.

**Two recorders, two install points, one command.** The HTTP recorder installs
from `post_worker_init`, which runs right after gunicorn's own `load_wsgi()`, so
`worker.wsgi` is already the site application and one line wraps it (verified on
gunicorn 26.1.0). The register recorder cannot use any hook, and this is not a
preference:

- `gnrserveprod.main()` builds `GnrWsgiSite` **before** it reads the `-c` file,
  and hands an already-built application to gunicorn, whose `load()` only returns
  it;
- `GnrWsgiSite.__init__` forces the register into existence, under genropy's own
  comment "this is needed, don't remove";
- so the client exists in the **master** process before any hook runs and before
  the fork. Measured: master and worker hold one inherited socket to the
  sitedaemon, same descriptor, same address pair.

Patching the name from the configuration file would therefore be a no-op on the
instance the site already holds. The launcher assigns the name before genropy's
entry point runs — one plain assignment, which is what makes the same recorder
installable on the bridge, where the call goes wherever the worker builds its
site.

### The run archive

**The archive is the recording target, not a place lines are loaded into
afterwards** (owner, 2026-08-23, reversing the JSONL-plus-loader shape this
bench carried for a day). Three arguments were weighed and the load-later shape
lost all three. A truncated JSONL line is possible when a process dies
mid-write, while a half-written SQLite row is not. The fixed-schema objection
dissolves with the one-JSON-column design below. Lock contention between the
bridge's worker processes is real as mechanics and harmless here: WAL serialises
the writers, and the two fidelity macro-phases do not read timings —
macro-phase 3, which does, runs with collection off. What decided it is the
fourth argument, already paid for: **a separate load step is a step that can be
forgotten**, and the reference session of 2026-08-23 was lost exactly in the
window between the run and its archiving. Writing into the archive removes the
window.

One file per run, `~/genro_bench/runs/<run_id>.sqlite`, or under
`GNR_BENCH_ARCHIVE_DIR` when that is set. **Outside the git tree** — the lines
carry whole bodies, the login with the bench password and the session cookies,
and this repository is public — and on a **local** filesystem, because WAL does
not work over network mounts.

```
run     run_id, started, conditions   -- one row: the declared conditions, as JSON
record  id, run_id, stack, kind, exchange_id, ts, thread, subject, status, line
```

`line` holds the **whole** record as JSON. The other columns are **promoted**,
each because it has a job: `run_id` and `exchange_id` to JOIN, `stack` to
SEPARATE, `ts` and `thread` to ORDER, `kind`, `subject` and `status` to FILTER.
A promoted column is always a **copy** of what the JSON still holds, never the
only place a value lives — otherwise the blob stops being the record and this is
a schema again. A field is promoted once it is queried often; an occasional
query reads inside the JSON with `json_extract(line, '$.field')`. There is no
schema version, by the same rule that governs the record shape: a line of a new
shape needs no migration.

- `kind` is `http` or `register`, so both recorders share one table and one join.
- `subject` is what the line is *about*: the path for an HTTP exchange, the verb
  for a register call. It is the column you filter on by hand.
- `exchange_id` goes in as **NULL** when the record has no such key — the
  faithful copy of an absence, which is what the master's boot calls are.
- `stack` is the one declared exception to the copy rule: it is a copy of the
  run's own declared condition, not of the record. Putting it in the record
  would change a record shape that has to stay identical on both stacks.

**How the two recorders find the same run.** `serve_legacy.py` mints the archive
and publishes its path in **`GNR_BENCH_RUN`** before genropy's entry point runs,
so before the fork. The register recorder is handed the archive object directly,
through a `partial` — genropy builds its client as `SiteRegisterClient(site)`,
with no room for a second argument. The HTTP recorder, born later in the worker,
attaches to the path in the environment. The environment is the channel because
it is the only one that survives both the **fork** on either stack and the
**spawn** of the bridge's template, which is started fresh.

**The connection is opened per process, never inherited.** A handle carried
across a fork is the same class of invisible defect as a shared file descriptor.

**A trap measured on 2026-08-23**: `sqlite3.connect` in a forked child
**segfaults** with sqlite 3.51.0 in WAL mode — SIGSEGV inside the C call, no
exception to catch. The bench venv carries sqlite 3.50.4 and does it cleanly,
which is why the recorded stack is unaffected and why `run_archive_check.py`
runs on the venv python. Same family as the libpq/Kerberos segfault that makes
`PGGSSENCMODE=disable` mandatory. Anyone moving the bench to a python with a
newer sqlite finds the gunicorn worker dying on its first recorded line.

### What lands in the archive, and what does not

**Filtered — one id-only stub line, never a body**:

- static assets, recognised by the **response content type** (javascript, css,
  images, fonts) plus `favicon.ico`;
- pings that rendered nothing.

A stub carries `exchange_id`, `ts`, `thread`, `method`, `path`, `query`,
`rpc_method`, `status` and `filtered` — the reason, `static` or `empty_ping`.
Nothing else: no bodies, no headers.

**Why a stub and not silence** (owner, 2026-08-23, amending his own filter). The
register recorder stamps every call with the exchange that caused it, filtered
exchanges included, so with no line at all those calls named an exchange the
HTTP lines did not contain: measured on the first reference session, 531 register
lines over 240 exchanges. And the ping is the carrier of the datachange half of
the register conversation — the half the bridge's emulation has no upstream test
suite for — so on the register side those exchanges are the material
macro-phase 2 most needs. Recognising them by guessing from their verbs is how an
artefact comes to read as a divergence. The rule the filter was built on is
intact: nothing recorded is ever cut, because a stub has no body to cut.

Recognition is by content type and never by path, except `favicon.ico`: the
decision is taken when the answer is known, with no guessing from the URL.

**The ping that rendered nothing is not an empty Bag** — that was the wrong
guess, and it made the filter never fire. `handle_ping` builds
`Bag(dict(result=None))` and adds a `dataChanges` node only when there is
something to deliver (`gnr/web/daemon/siteregister.py:928`), so on the wire the
idle answer is the bare envelope:

```xml
<GenRoBag><result _T="NN"></result></GenRoBag>
```

That shape — a null `result` and nothing else — is what the filter matches. As
soon as `dataChanges` appears the exchange is recorded.

**Recorded whole, with no truncation anywhere**: everything else. RPC calls,
pages, XML, JSON — and the pings that *do* carry a datachange, because that Bag
is the register answering, and it is what the replica compares in macro-phase 2.

One `http` line per exchange, with these fields inside `line`:

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `exchange_id` | the join key with the register lines (a promoted column too) |
| `filtered` | present only on a stub: `static` or `empty_ping`. A stub carries none of the fields below except `status` |
| `ts`, `thread` | wall clock and thread ident (16 threads interleave) |
| `method`, `path`, `query` | the request line |
| `req_headers`, `req_body`, `req_len` | whole request |
| `rpc_method`, `form` | the RPC method and the form payload, parsed as `capture_proxy.py` does (`method` or `_M`) |
| `status`, `resp_headers`, `resp_body`, `resp_len` | whole response; headers as a list of pairs, so a repeated `Set-Cookie` survives |
| `gnr_headers` | the `X-Gnr*` breakdown: `X-GnrTime`, `X-GnrSqlTime`, `X-GnrSqlCount`, `X-GnrXMLTime`, `X-GnrXMLSize` |
| `duration_ms` | entry to end of the body, measured by the recorder |
| `recorder_error` | present only when the recorder itself failed on that exchange |

A failure inside the recorder is written as `recorder_error` and **never**
reaches the response: the response is served intact and the trace says the line
is incomplete.

The `X-Gnr*` headers only arrive on the page-serving path — they are set by
`setResultInResponse` (`gnrwsgisite.py:1371`). Statics would not have them, and
statics are not recorded anyway. With debug off, `X-GnrSqlTime` and
`X-GnrSqlCount` arrive as `0`; see the declared conditions above.

### What the register lines carry

One `register` line per call **the site made** — never one per wire round trip. Three
surfaces, and the line says which one it was intercepted on:

| Surface | What it means |
|---|---|
| `client` | a method declared on `SiteRegisterClient` (`get_item`, `page`, `new_page`, `refresh`, the four `*Store` builders, …) |
| `passthrough` | a name the legacy class's `__getattr__` forwards to the register (`drop_page`, `setInClientData`, `handle_ping`, …) |
| `store` | a call on a `ServerStore` handed back by one of the `*Store` builders |

The wrapper is an **object** standing in place of the client, not a patch on
`__getattr__`. That funnel is bypassed by about 26 methods declared on the class,
and the bridge's own client has no `__getattr__` at all — a recorder built on the
funnel would record nothing there.

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `exchange_id` | the join key with the HTTP lines — a full record or a stub. **Absent** when the call belongs to no exchange, and NULL in the promoted column |
| `ordinal` | position within its exchange, from 1 |
| `surface`, `verb` | where it was intercepted, and the name called |
| `args`, `kwargs` | the arguments |
| `result` | the answer |
| `wire_calls` | round trips the call cost: `0` when it never left the process, `1` normally, more when the shape costs more or the legacy loop retried |
| `wire_error` | the error class the legacy retry loop swallowed, when it swallowed one |
| `error` | the exception that reached the site, when one did |
| `duration_ms`, `ts`, `thread`, `pid` | timing and provenance |
| `register_name`, `register_item_id` | store lines only: which register and which item |
| `recorder_error` | present only when the recorder itself failed on that call |

**`wire_calls` is counted on the Pyro proxy, not guessed.** The legacy retry loop
lives inside the closure `SiteRegisterClient.__getattr__` builds, and its
`except Exception` neither logs nor re-raises: from outside that funnel a
fourfold failure is indistinguishable from a legitimate `None`. Counting on the
wire and attributing to the call in flight on that thread is what makes the
number true, and it keeps one line per call. The two groups behave differently
and the trace shows it rather than hiding it: a `passthrough` verb can carry
`wire_calls: 4` with a `wire_error` and a `null` result, while a `client` method
raises and carries an `error`.

**The field is not called `attempts`, and the name was changed after it misled
its first reader** into taking a routine number for a retry. What one call costs
on the wire is a property of its shape, measured on the fake wire:

| Call | Round trips |
|---|---|
| `pageStore(...)` and the other `*Store` builders | 0 — the store is built in process |
| `store.register_item` | 1 |
| `store.data` | 2 — `ServerStore.data` evaluates `self.register_item` twice |
| `store.getItem(path)` | those 2, plus one on the remotebag proxy, which is not counted here |

So a Bag read through a store shows `wire_calls: 2` and has retried nothing. A
retry shows as more round trips than the shape costs, together with a
`wire_error`. On the bridge there is no per-call retry and no wire at all, so the
numbers will differ by nature — which is a real difference between the stacks and
not an artefact of the instrument.

**The calls with no exchange are recorded, not filtered.** The register client is
born in the master process, so the site's own boot makes real register calls
before any exchange exists: those lines simply have no `exchange_id` key. An
absent exchange is absent — never faked, never inherited from whatever ran last
on that thread. They are material the replica will want, since the bridge boots
its registers too.

**What is deliberately not recorded twice**: the call a store makes internally on
the client. A store keeps the client it was built from, so `set_datachange` on a
store produces the store line and no client line. A line is a call the site made.

**Values are written to be comparable between runs.** A Bag goes in as its XML:
the default `repr` carries no content and a memory address that changes at every
run would read as a divergence. Anything else goes in as its `repr` with the
address stripped. Long values are truncated with their real length appended.

The archive **opens its connection per process**. The wrapper is born in the
master, and a handle inherited across the fork would let two processes step on
each other — the same class of invisible defect as a recorder fault reaching the
response.

## The bridge side

The same two recorders, on the other stack. What changes is only how they are
caught — the lines they write are the same shape, field by field, and the
comparison of macro-phase 2 reads lines, never mechanisms.

### What is different, and why

| | legacy | bridge |
|---|---|---|
| Processes | gunicorn **forks** one master into workers | the pool **spawns** each worker as a fresh `python -m` process |
| The register | a daemon on the other side of a Pyro socket | in-process, inside the worker itself |
| The register client | `SiteRegisterClient`, most of its surface behind one `__getattr__` | `GenropyRegisterClient`, 49 explicit methods and no funnel at all |
| HTTP recorder install | `post_worker_init` in the gunicorn config | one call in the worker's constructor |
| Register recorder install | an assignment from `serve_legacy.py`, in the master | the same assignment, in the worker, before the site is built |
| Concurrency | 1 process, 16 threads | up to 6 workers, thread pools left at the core's defaults |

Two consequences reach the recorded lines, and both are real differences between
the stacks rather than artefacts of the instrument:

- **`surface` is always `client`.** There is no `__getattr__` to pass through, so
  the `passthrough` lines of the legacy trace have no counterpart here.
- **`wire_calls` is always 1.** The register lives in the worker's own process
  and no call costs a round trip. On legacy the same field counts what the call
  cost on the wire, which is how a swallowed retry stays visible; here there is
  nothing to swallow.

Everything else is identical, and that is checked rather than asserted: the
machinery that builds a line is *inherited* from `register_recorder.py` instead
of being written a second time.

### The three pieces

- **`bridge_recipe.py`** — the server recipe. The install rides the recipe: the
  pool names its worker class and its engine factory as import strings that the
  worker and template processes resolve for themselves, so a recipe naming the
  bench's two classes installs both recorders. Nothing is patched, no
  environment switch, no `sitecustomize`, and neither kajenn nor
  genropy-kajenn is modified. It is the shipped recipe transcribed with TWO lines
  changed, and the coverage check builds both and fails if anything else comes
  to differ.
- **`recording_engine_factory.py`** — `RecordingSiteEngineFactory`, the shipped
  `GenropySiteEngineFactory` subclassed. The group's workers are born by fork
  out of a template process that builds the `GnrWsgiSite` once for all of them,
  and `GnrWsgiSite.__init__` forces `site.register` into existence, so the
  register client exists in the TEMPLATE before any worker constructor runs.
  This factory assigns the recording client into `gnr.web.gnrwsgisite` right
  before it builds the site. It binds that client to a `TemplateArchive`, which
  swallows lines: see **The template writes nothing** below.
- **`recording_worker.py`** — `RecordingGenropyWorker`, a `GenropyWorker`
  subclass, both of whose calls run in the forked CHILD. It gives the inherited
  register recorder the run's own archive in place of the `TemplateArchive`, and
  wraps `wsgi_app` with the HTTP recorder, outermost, so the exchange header is
  in the environ before anything reads the request.
- **`register_recorder_mixin.py`** — the mixin. Where the legacy client could be
  shadowed by a wrapper object catching every attribute, this one declares
  everything explicitly, so the recording client is a real **subclass** and each
  recorded verb is an override delegating to the parent.

### The template writes nothing

The process every worker is forked from must never open a SQLite connection. On
the sqlite the bridge runs — 3.51.0, pyenv python 3.12.9 — a forked child dies of
SIGSEGV as soon as its parent has opened a connection of its own: no exception to
catch, no line written, and INTERMITTENTLY, two runs in three. Not WAL, not the
same file, and closing before the fork does not help — what poisons the child is
the library having been initialised at all. Measured 2026-08-25. The legacy venv
carries sqlite 3.50.4, which does the same thing cleanly, which is why the
gunicorn stack has never met this.

Seen on the bench before it was understood: the first fork recipe let the
template write its lines, and its forked worker was killed after never presenting
itself, leaving `no room for a newcomer: the pool is restricted`.

So the register client the factory installs is bound to a `TemplateArchive` that
drops what it is given, and each forked worker swaps in the run's archive as its
first act. What is dropped is the handful of register calls the site makes while
it is being built — four on the bridge, two on legacy, already different because
the two stacks build the site in different processes. They carry no
`exchange_id`, so no comparison has ever read them. Declared, because a silent
drop is a divergence nobody can see afterwards.

Measured on the login smoke of 2026-08-25, fork recipe against spawn recipe:
**380 register lines carrying an exchange on both, and the same 52 distinct
`site_caller` chains** — the fork changed nothing about what the site records.

### Only the outermost call is recorded

A line is a call the SITE made. On legacy that came for free: the wrapper stands
in front of the client and is not in its internal call path, so a command
calling another command produced one line. A subclass **is** in that path, and
the bridge's client calls six of its own public commands internally
(`get_item`, `local_item`, `pages`, `set_datachange`, `set_serverstore_changes`,
`subscribe_path`), while every `ServerStore` delegates its whole conversation
back to the client that made it.

Recorded naively the bridge's trace would carry lines the legacy one cannot
have, and macro-phase 2 would read a divergence produced by the instrument. So a
call that begins while another is already being recorded runs untouched. The
coverage check asserts both halves of that: the store's own conversation IS
recorded, its inner client calls are NOT.

### The trap: one file, two module names, two classes

The daemon override installs `genropy_kajenn.siteregister` into `sys.modules` as
`gnr.web.daemon`. A module reachable under **both** dotted names can end up
executed twice — the same file then yields two distinct class objects, and an
`isinstance` between them is False.

Measured on 2026-08-24: importing the client as
`genropy_kajenn.siteregister.siteregister_client` after the alias had already
loaded it produced a second copy, and the `ServerStore` handed back by one was
invisible to the other — every store call would have gone unrecorded, in
silence. So every bench module imports the client **the way the site imports
it**, from `gnr.web.daemon.siteregister_client`, and the coverage check pins
that: the class the site's own module holds must be the very one the mixin
subclasses.

Same family as the two other traps this bench has already paid for: the
libpq/Kerberos segfault behind `PGGSSENCMODE=disable`, and the SQLite one below.

### The SQLite trap does not bite here

The bridge runs on a python whose sqlite is **3.51.0** — the version that
segfaults when a connection is opened in a **forked** child in WAL mode, the
reason `run_archive_check.py` runs on the bench venv instead. The pool does not
fork: every worker is a fresh process, so there is nothing inherited to break.
Measured on 2026-08-24: parent and spawned child writing concurrently into one
WAL archive, clean.

### Declared conditions of a bridge run

Read by `serve_bridge.py` where each one is true and stored as data in the run
row, exactly as on the legacy side. The keys the two stacks share read side by
side; the ones only this stack has are the two extra packages and the commits.

| Condition | Standard value |
|---|---|
| Stack | bridge: `genropy-kajenn`, the register in-process, no daemon |
| Processes / threads | pool ceiling 6 (`worker_max_number`), thread pools at the core's defaults |
| Recorders | both, installed by the recipe naming the recording worker |
| Debug | **off** (`--nodebug`) — same reason as on the legacy side |
| Database | `test_invoice_pg`, postgres localhost:5432 — the same db the legacy twin serves; in a REPLICA cycle the copy `test_invoice_pg_replica` instead, see *The replica cycle against the bridge* |
| Bind | `127.0.0.1:8098` (the legacy stack keeps 8099) |

**Why the commits are recorded and the versions are not enough.** genropy,
kajenn and genropy-kajenn are all installed **editable** on this side, so a
distribution version records the moment of installation, not the code that ran:
genropy reports `26.6.8` here and `26.8.19.1` in the legacy venv, while both are
the same working tree. Verified on 2026-08-24 by hashing the 319 `.py` files of
the ten shared packages (`app core db dev lib prj sql utils web xtnd`): byte for
byte identical. The run row therefore carries `genropy_commit` and
`kajenn_commit` beside the version strings, and it is the commits that say
whether two runs compared the same code.

### Running the bridge with both recorders

Hygiene first, as always: no stale process on 8098, and the legacy stack down if
it is still up. Then, from the repository root:

```bash
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \
    PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy \
    PGGSSENCMODE=disable python benchmarks/compare/serve_bridge.py test_invoice_pg \
    -p 8098 --nodebug
```

Every argument is the `genropy-kajenn` command line; the launcher adds only
`--config benchmarks/compare/bridge_recipe.py`, and leaves a `--config` the
caller named alone. It prints the archive it is recording into.

What the launcher owns is the RUN, not the install: it puts `benchmarks/compare`
on the import path — in this process and in the environment the pool's template
inherits, which is how `recording_engine_factory` and `recording_worker` are
resolved — mints the archive with the conditions above, and publishes its path
in `GNR_BENCH_RUN`. The environment is the only channel that reaches the
template: it is started fresh by an exec, and no object crosses that, which is
exactly why the two recorders were built to agree on a path rather than on an
inherited handle.

The recipe itself does nothing but declare. That is deliberate: building a
recipe has to stay free of consequences, or the drift check could not build it.

**The first worker may be killed before it presents itself.** Building a
`GnrWsgiSite` can outrun the pool's 10s presentation timeout on a cold start;
the pool logs `its process never presented itself` and starts another, which
comes up. Observed on 2026-08-24 with the recorders installed, and it is not
theirs: they add nothing to the site build. Worth knowing so the traceback in
the log is not read as a failure of the bench. Under the fork recipe the site is
already built when a worker is forked, so the child presents at once (observed
2026-08-25) — the same message with NO second worker coming up is a different
animal, and the first thing to suspect is the template having touched sqlite.

## The reference session

What the collection produces is a **reference**: one archived run of a session
performed in the browser, plus the recipe to make another. There is no script
beside it — in the replica shape the recorded lines *are* the script the replica
reads, and a hand-written sequence next to them would be a second source of
truth free to drift.

**The archive is never committed, and it is kept.** The lines carry whole
bodies: the login exchange with the bench password, the session cookies, and
this repository is public — so the file lives outside the tree. It is kept
because the recipe alone is not enough: a session performed by hand in a browser
does not reproduce identically, and the clean restart wipes the register at every
run. Measured and unrecoverable a minute later is what happened on 2026-08-23,
before the archive existed.

**One reference per stack, the same session.** The steps 3 to 5 below are
identical on both sides — that is the whole point: what differs between the two
archives must be the stacks, not what was done to them. Only the bring-up and
the shutdown differ.

The session, under the declared conditions above and starting from an empty
register:

1. hygiene — no stale process on 8098, 8099 or 40004, and the register empty.
   **Legacy**: stop gunicorn and the sitedaemon, delete `siteregister_data.pik`
   from the site folder. **Bridge**: stop the server; there is no pickle to
   delete, the registers live in the workers and die with them. Nothing to
   delete on the recording side either way: the run mints its own file;
2. start the stack — **legacy**: the sitedaemon (step 4), then `serve_legacy.py`;
   **bridge**: `serve_bridge.py` alone. Either prints the archive it is
   recording into;
3. in the browser, log in with an account from `benchmarks/usernames.txt`,
   password `a`;
4. open one table page and let the grid load;
5. open one record, change one field, save it.

Do it in a **private window**, so the login really lands in the archive instead
of being skipped by a session cookie left over from a previous run.

Then that archive is the reference: every register line joins an HTTP exchange by
`exchange_id` — a full record or the stub of a filtered one — except the boot
calls, which have no exchange by construction.

**Close the run before reading it.** Stop the server first — gunicorn then the
sitedaemon on legacy, `serve_bridge.py` on the bridge — because while they run
the browser's idle pings keep landing in the archive and any census taken
earlier stops matching. Then fold the WAL into the file itself, so the
`.sqlite` alone is the whole archive and nobody loses the tail by copying it
without its `-wal` companion:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/genro_bench/runs/<run_id>.sqlite 'PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);'
```

**Reading it back.** The join, and the census that says whether the run is whole:

```sql
-- register lines naming an exchange the HTTP lines do not carry: must be 0
SELECT count(*) FROM record r
 WHERE r.kind = 'register' AND r.exchange_id IS NOT NULL
   AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM record h WHERE h.kind = 'http'
                     AND h.run_id = r.run_id AND h.exchange_id = r.exchange_id);

-- the census of a run
SELECT kind, count(*) FROM record GROUP BY kind;
SELECT json_extract(line, '$.filtered') AS filtered, count(*)
  FROM record WHERE kind = 'http' GROUP BY filtered;
SELECT json_extract(line, '$.surface') AS surface, count(*)
  FROM record WHERE kind = 'register' GROUP BY surface;

-- one RPC exchange and the register conversation it caused, in order
SELECT subject, json_extract(line, '$.rpc_method') FROM record
 WHERE kind = 'http' AND json_extract(line, '$.rpc_method') IS NOT NULL;
SELECT json_extract(line, '$.ordinal'), surface, subject,
       json_extract(line, '$.args'), json_extract(line, '$.wire_calls')
  FROM record WHERE kind = 'register' AND exchange_id = '<the id>'
 ORDER BY json_extract(line, '$.ordinal');
```

**Recorded evidence, reference run `legacy-20260823T232924`** under the declared
conditions above (debug off, 1 process and 16 threads, register empty at start,
both recorders, db `test_invoice_pg`), performed in a private window so the login
is really in the archive. The session was login, one table page with its grid,
one record opened, one field changed and saved:

| | |
|---|---|
| HTTP exchanges | 266 — 32 full records, 234 stubs |
| Stub reasons | 223 `static`, 11 `empty_ping` |
| Register calls | 1788, on 17 threads — 833 `client`, 878 `store`, 77 `passthrough` |
| Unjoinable register lines | 0 |
| Calls with the exchange absent | 2, both the master's boot |
| `recorder_error` | 0 |
| Register calls per RPC exchange | 25 exchanges: 5 minimum, 25 median, 92 maximum |
| RPC methods in the run | `*|login:LoginComponent;login_checkAvatar`, `*|login:LoginComponent;login_doLogin`, `main`, `getRemoteTranslation`, `app.dbSelect`, `app.getSelection`, `app.checkFreezedSelection`, `loadRecordCluster`, `saveRecordCluster` |

The two login calls arrive with their component prefix in the `method` field —
that is what the wire carries when the login page is a component, and the flat
`user=`/`password=` fields plus the XML Bag of the login trap are unchanged
underneath.

**The filtered exchanges are not free, which is why they get a stub.** Their
register traffic, measured on this run:

| Filtered exchange | Count | Register calls each | Verbs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `static` | 223 | 2 | `globalStore`, `getItem` on the global register |
| `empty_ping` | 11 | 5 | `globalStore` and `getItem` twice, then `handle_ping` |

501 register calls on exchanges the HTTP lines would otherwise not have
mentioned. And the split is only knowable *because* of the stub: before it, both
shapes were exchanges with no HTTP line, and a two-line one could not be told
from a ping — an earlier run of the same session showed 223 two-line and 17
five-line exchanges with no way to say which was which, and the guess made at
the time (all of it ping traffic) was wrong: the two-line ones are statics.

**What one RPC exchange looks like read out of the archive.** `saveRecordCluster`
in the reference run, its 32 ordinals unbroken: the identity reads on the global,
connection and page stores, then `get_dbenv`, then `subscribed_tables` →
`filter_subscribed_tables` → `notifyDbEvents` on `invc.customer`, then
`subscription_storechanges`, then the page lock — `__enter__`, `get`, `setItem`,
`__exit__` — around the write. Every `getItem` on a store costs `wire_calls: 2`
for the reason given above, and every `*Store` builder costs 0: the store is
built in process.

## The replica

`replica.py` reads an archived run and performs it again, by network calls,
against a live stack. There is no script beside the archive: the recorded lines
ARE what the replica reads, so nothing can drift away from what really happened.
Any archived run serves — the reference session is a role, not a format.

```bash
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \
    PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy \
    python benchmarks/compare/replica.py ~/genro_bench/runs/<run_id>.sqlite \
    --target 127.0.0.1:8099
```

**Parity first, and it is a refusal.** `genropy_parity_check.py` runs before the
first request and the replica stops dead if it fails. It asks two questions,
which are not the same question: is this interpreter importing the pinned tree,
and does the frozen copy in `temp/legacy_venv` carry the same source as the pin?
The first is a path comparison, the second a file-by-file comparison of every
`*.py` under `gnr/`, skipping `__pycache__` and the five top-level subtrees the
wheel copies in but no runtime reads there (`projects`, `resources`, `webtools`,
`dojo_libs`, `gnrjs`). With those out the two sets match file for file, 320
against 320. The report names what is wrong and prints the remedy.

**What it replays, and what it leaves out.** Two declared rules — declared,
because a silent skip is a divergence nobody can see afterwards:

| Left out | Why | What is therefore never compared |
|---|---|---|
| `/_ping` | a heartbeat on a timer; what a ping carries depends on when it fires | the delivery of datachanges through a ping |
| statics | 223 of the 266 exchanges of the reference session, each producing the same pair of register calls (`globalStore`, `getItem`) | the serving of static assets |

The 2026-08-23 reference session therefore replays as **31 exchanges**: login,
the TH page of `invc/customer`, its grid, one record opened, one field changed
and saved.

**Identifiers.** A page id minted by one stack means nothing to the other. The
replica keeps a map from the token in the trace to the token the target minted
in its place, learned from the HTML the target returns, and rewrites it wherever
it appears — in the form values AND in the query string, because the GET of a TH
page carries `_calling_page_id` there. Cookies are never replayed: the client
keeps its own jar. `callcounter` is not adapted either — the sequence replayed
is the sequence recorded, so the counter of the trace is the right one.

**The pairing.** Every request carries the exchange it is replaying, as the
`X-Bench-Replica-Of` request header. The HTTP recorder already writes every
request header into its line, so the replica run's archive says by itself which
reference exchange each of its own reproduces — no recorder changes, no new
field in the record.

**Order, not timing — and the one status that follows from it.** The exchanges
go out one after another on a single keep-alive connection, with no waiting in
between. A browser does not: it sends calls that overlap. When the reply recorded
in the trace says the connection had already been rotated, AND the trace shows
that exchange running while an earlier one was still in flight on the same
pre-rotation cookie, the recorded status is a **race of the reference session**,
not a divergence of the stack. The replay names it and carries on; it never
passes it in silence.

Measured on the reference session: the two `login_doLogin` calls overlap by
22.8 ms — the first starts at 23:48:03.859 on thread 6245068800 and lasts
32.2 ms, the second starts 23:48:03.882 on another thread, both carrying the
pre-login cookie. The first rotates the connection, so the second answers 400
with genropy's own `The connection is not longer valid`. A replica replaying
them one after the other gets the 200 the site owes a legitimate call.

**Recorded evidence, replay of 2026-08-25** (`legacy-20260825T080505`), the
reference session against the legacy stack under the pin:

| | |
|---|---|
| Exchanges replayed | 31 of 31 |
| Statuses matching the trace | 30 exact, 1 recognised race |
| Register lines recorded | 1379 |
| Exchanges carrying the pairing header | 31 |
| Unjoinable register lines | 0 |

## The structural comparison

`structural_diff.py` says whether the replica reproduced the session or only
looked like it. It compares the two runs exchange by exchange, in order, and the
replay stops at the first difference nothing declares — while both stacks are
still standing, which is the whole reason this is a replica and not an offline
diff of two finished traces.

**How the two runs are joined.** By the `X-Bench-Replica-Of` header the replica
stamps on every call. Nothing outside the two archives is kept in step. A replay
also remembers where it started in the target's archive, because a stack records
every cycle into the file it minted at startup: without that, a second replay
would compare itself against the first one's lines and pass every time.

**Equal means equal by structure.** Two exchanges agree when their register lines
carry the same sequence of calls and the same SHAPE of arguments and answers.
What a second run legitimately changes is masked or dropped:

| In the line | Compared as |
|---|---|
| a 22-character identifier (page id, connection id, register item id), wherever it sits | `<id>` |
| a timestamp, a date, a `datetime.datetime(...)` repr | `<ts>`, `<date>`, `<datetime>` |
| an answer that is a Bag | the PATHS of its nodes, values dropped, attribute names kept |
| an answer that is a dict repr — a register item | the NAMES of its keys, values dropped |
| everything else, numbers included | its masked text |

So a register item whose `start_ts` moved is not a difference and a register item
that lost a key is; a Bag whose `workdate` changed is not and a Bag that lost a
node is. Measured on the browser session of 2026-08-23 against its own replay:
of the 636 register lines whose call sequence already agreed, 29 differ on the
raw answer and 12 on the shape — and those 12 are real.

**What the report carries.** It opens on its own inputs, read from the archives
and never from the command line: the two files, the stack and the genropy commit
each declares, the instance and the database each ran on, and how many exchanges
the reference holds. Then one line per exchange — the request, the status, and
the duration each STACK recorded for it. Both numbers come from the HTTP recorder
wrapping the application, in the process that served the request, so they are the
same metre on the same call: the replay sends the recorded method, path and body,
with only the identifiers the target mints rewritten. Then the closing TABLE, one row per exchange
and a total: the exchange, its status, the register calls each stack made and the
response time each stack recorded, with the signed percentage between the two.
The columns are titled with the stack names the archives declare — `legacy` and
`bridge` — not "reference" and "replica". An exchange names the URL it asked for
and the page file the site ran for it: the URL is in hand the moment the request
arrives, but it does not always say which page it is — genropy lets the main
package and `index` be omitted, so `/` on this instance means `/invc/index` — and
the site resolves that inside, after the middleware handed the request over. What
it resolved comes back on the way out, written into the reply as the `pageModule`
of the `gnr.GenroClient` the page bootstraps with, which is where the report
reads it. An exchange the comparison left out
shows a dash in the register columns and its reason under the table, but keeps
its times: a response time is a response time even where the register lines are
not compared.
**Those durations are still not a benchmark** — both stacks run under two
recorders and the reference was served while a driver or a browser was driving
it; timings are macro-phase 3's work, under its own declared conditions.

On a divergence it also carries the verdict, the kind of difference, the register
call number, the exchange as the replay printed it, the two lines side by side
and the `site_caller` of both. Naming the caller is what makes it a diagnosis
rather than a count:

```
DIVERGENCE: arguments at register call 45 of [4] GET /
  reference: store:getItem(CACHE_TS._mainpref_) -> None
  replica:   store:getItem(CACHE_TS.alexander.king_preference) -> None
  reference caller: gnr/web/gnrwebapp.py:27 getItem <- packages/adm/model/preference.py:23 getMainStorePreference <- packages/adm/model/preference.py:57 getPreference
  replica caller:   gnr/web/gnrwebapp.py:27 getItem <- packages/adm/model/user.py:153 getPreference <- gnr/web/gnrwsgisite.py:1669 getUserPreference
```

That one was produced on purpose, by replaying the same reference twice against
a stack whose register the first replay had already populated — which is exactly
what the register-empty rule of every run exists to prevent.

**The cold start is not compared.** The exchanges a run performs BEFORE its
first RPC carry no register line into the comparison, and the skip is printed on
the run. Each stack finishes building lazily there and builds in a different
process: the bridge's site is built in the TEMPLATE its workers fork from, whose
register lines are dropped by construction, while the legacy builds the same
things in the process that serves the request and records them. Measured on
2026-08-25 by making the template print what it swallows: its four lines are the
`_mainpref_` read the legacy master makes too, plus the freshness check that
instantiates `storage_gnr` — the very pair the bridge's first exchange appeared
to be missing. The rule is computed from the reference archive
(`TraceReader.cold_start_exchanges`), so no recorder holds a flag a second
bridge worker would not have, and a run with no RPC at all has no cold start:
the rule can never silence a whole comparison. Those exchanges are still
REPLAYED — the page the RPCs need is created there. What it costs: the
connection register item is not compared at BIRTH, only from the first RPC on.

**The declared-rules table.** A difference a rule recognises is reported as
`known` and the replay carries on; everything else stops it. Nothing is
recognised implicitly. Today the table holds one rule, `reference-race`, the one
Phase 2 measured — the recorded status a browser produced by overlapping two
calls, which a replay sending them one after the other cannot reproduce. **A rule
is written only from a signature somebody observed.** The known bridge
divergences of `../../temp/problemi_kajenn_dal_ponte_2026-08-22.md` (S1, S2,
S3, S5) are facts between workers and produce no line at all on a
legacy-vs-legacy run, so their rules are added when the first cycle against the
bridge shows them and not before.

**The cycle, and why it is two starts.** Both runs must begin from an empty
register, so the reference and the replay each get their own clean stack and
their own archive:

```bash
# 1. clean restart, then record the reference
python3 benchmarks/compare/drive_login.py alexander.king 8099
# 2. clean restart again; the launcher prints the archive it minted
# 3. replay the reference against it, and compare

        --target 127.0.0.1:8099 \

```

Without `--target-archive` the replay only replays, as it did before.

**Recorded evidence, the self-check of 2026-08-25**: reference
`legacy-20260825T083754` (4 exchanges, 384 register lines) replayed against the
legacy stack recording into `legacy-20260825T083834` (4 exchanges, 384 register
lines, 0 unjoinable). All four statuses exact, **382 register lines compared,
zero divergences**, exit 0. It is the check that validates the comparison and the
identifier adaptation together: a stack compared with itself must agree.

`http_recorder_check.py` needs nothing running: a minimal WSGI app, a recorder
wrapping it, a throwaway archive, and 29 assertions over the filters, the stub of
a filtered exchange, the whole bodies and the four guarantees about failure —
on the request side, on the reply side, inside the archive writer itself, and
the one added on 2026-08-24: a site that dies before returning a body still
leaves its line. It
is the machine evidence that a fault inside the recorder never reaches the
response — kept versioned rather than in a scratch file, because evidence that
gets deleted is not evidence.

`run_archive_check.py` needs nothing running either, and runs on the bench venv
for the sqlite reason above: 17 assertions over the schema, the run row and its
conditions, WAL, attaching to an existing archive, every promoted column as a
copy of the JSON, the absent exchange as NULL, the join in both directions, and
the connection that is never inherited across a fork.

`register_recorder_check.py` needs nothing running either, but it does need the
bench venv, because the recorder imports genropy: 35 assertions over the two
client surfaces, the store and its lock, the legacy retry loop (the real one —
the client is built past its `__init__` with a fake proxy in place of the wire),
the absent exchange, the comparable values, and the promise that a fault inside
the recorder — the archive writer included — never reaches the site. Among them, one guards a trap worth naming:
`register.locked_exception` is a **class**, so it is callable, and a wrapped
class stops matching the `except` clause that uses it — silently, in a path that
only runs once something has already gone wrong. The wrapper hands back anything
that is not a routine untouched, and `inspect.isroutine` is the guard, not
`callable`.

`bridge_coverage_check.py` needs nothing running and runs on the bridge's own
interpreter: 29 assertions, and it is the one check whose job is to fail *later*
rather than now. The bridge recorder is a mixin over an explicit list of verbs,
which can silently fall behind the client it shadows — the legacy wrapper never
could, since it caught everything — so this check compares the list against the
client's live surface in both directions and says which name appeared or
disappeared. It guards the second copy this side needs as well: it builds the
bench recipe and the shipped one through the runtime's own read door and
compares the WHOLE rendered document — listener, middleware, applications,
console gate, commander and pool — failing if anything but the worker class
differs. Comparing the pool alone was not enough, measured on 2026-08-24: with
the bench recipe's listener port changed and its entire middleware section
deleted, the pool-only version still reported no drift. It also checks that the
debug the run row declares is the debug the recipe applies, for every
combination of the flag and the environment variable. Then it pins the
module-identity trap described above, and exercises the recorder itself on a
stub site — one line for the call the site made, none for the calls the client
makes on itself, the store handed back wrapped and its own conversation
recorded.

The two env vars are not optional: without the provider the check would look at
the legacy Pyro client instead of the bridge's — which is exactly the mistake it
exists to catch, so it fails loudly on its first assertion rather than passing
against the wrong class.

`structural_diff_check.py` needs nothing running and runs on the bridge
interpreter, because the reader it uses lives in `replica.py`: 33 assertions over
two throwaway archives written line by line — the pairing and the anchor that
keeps two replays apart, the shape rule in both directions (a value that moved is
not a difference, a key or a node that disappeared is), the alignment of two call
sequences (an extra call, a missing one, a different one), the first difference
being the one reported, the declared-rules table taking one off the table without
silencing it, and the report reading without the code.

`drive_login.py` replays a real login against the running site over HTTP, no
browser involved: it reuses `replay_a1.build_plan` to pull the two login
pageCalls out of the captured session and `scaling_probe.login_user` to replay
them on one keep-alive connection, with the identity rewritten in **both** places
(see the login trap above). Default user `alexander.king`, password `a`. Use it
to leave a login in the archive whenever a recorder changes.

Wrapping the app costs the `wsgi.file_wrapper` fast path: gunicorn only takes it
when the application returns a file wrapper, and the recorder returns a
generator. Irrelevant for fidelity work, worth knowing before anyone reads
timings off a recorded run.

## The replica cycle against the bridge

The comparison above, run for real: a reference recorded on the legacy stack,
replayed against the bridge. It is the same replay and the same comparison — what
this section adds is the **database**, because the bridge writes.

**The bridge runs on a copy of the db, made at cycle start.** The roadmap allows
writes on the bridge side from the first exchange, and the reference must stay
reproducible: a replay that wrote into `test_invoice_pg` would move the data the
reference was recorded against, and no later cycle could reproduce what it holds.
So the copy is dropped and recreated at every cycle start, and the bridge serves
a twin instance that names it.

The copy is a **recipe step run by hand, before the launcher** — like every other
step of this bench. It cannot live inside `replica.py`: by the time the replay
starts, the bridge already holds connections on the copy, and `createdb -T` needs
its template free as well.

```bash
dropdb --if-exists test_invoice_pg_replica
createdb -T test_invoice_pg test_invoice_pg_replica
```

**The twin instance**, `test_invoice_pg_replica`, is the `_legacy` twin recipe
again — configuration only, no `site/data/`, no `_static/` — with ONE change: the
`db` node names the copy.

```bash
INST=~/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/projects/test_invoice/instances
mkdir -p "$INST/test_invoice_pg_replica/site"
sed 's/dbname="test_invoice_pg"/dbname="test_invoice_pg_replica"/' \
    "$INST/test_invoice_pg/instanceconfig.xml" \
    > "$INST/test_invoice_pg_replica/instanceconfig.xml"
cp "$INST/test_invoice_pg/root.py"             "$INST/test_invoice_pg_replica/root.py"
cp "$INST/test_invoice_pg/site/siteconfig.xml" "$INST/test_invoice_pg_replica/site/siteconfig.xml"
```

**And `replica.py` refuses a cycle that would write into the reference's db.**
Beside the genropy parity gate, at cycle start: when the two archives declare
DIFFERENT stacks and the SAME `database.dbname`, the replay never reaches the
wire. It names both runs and prints the two commands above.

The question is asked of the pair and only across stacks. A run replayed against
its own stack — the self-check that validates the comparison — shares the db with
its reference by construction, and refusing it would refuse the one run that
proves the comparison works. Two DIFFERENT stacks on one db are not two stacks
being compared; they are two stacks writing over each other.

For a same-stack replay the db is shared, and on a login-only reference that is
harmless. It stops being harmless as soon as the reference WRITES: replaying such
a session twice starts from two different db states, and the difference reads as a
divergence the stacks did not cause. Copy the db for repeat same-stack replays
too.

**The cycle, in order.** Hygiene first, as always: nothing listening on 8098.

```bash
# 1. the copy, and the twin instance if it is not there yet
dropdb --if-exists test_invoice_pg_replica
createdb -T test_invoice_pg test_invoice_pg_replica
# 2. the bridge on the twin instance; it prints the archive it minted
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \
    PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy \
    PGGSSENCMODE=disable python benchmarks/compare/serve_bridge.py \
    test_invoice_pg_replica -p 8098 --nodebug
# 3. replay a legacy reference against it, and compare
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \
    PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy \
    python benchmarks/compare/replica.py ~/genro_bench/runs/<reference>.sqlite \
        --target 127.0.0.1:8098 \
        --target-archive ~/genro_bench/runs/<the run just minted>.sqlite
```

Wait for the bridge on its LOG — `Application startup complete` — never on a
request to the site. A readiness probe is an exchange, and the launcher records
it: it lands in the archive as a line no reference asks for. Harmless to the
comparison, which anchors itself to the archive at replay start and joins by the
`X-Bench-Replica-Of` header, but it is a line nobody wrote on purpose.

Teardown is the launcher's own: stop it, and the pool goes with it. The copy db
is left standing — the next cycle drops it.

**Recorded evidence, the first CLEAN cycle, 2026-08-25.** Reference
`legacy-20260825T151337` (4 exchanges, 152 register lines — the figure a login
costs on genropy `a1c0a8dd0`, where #1154 cut the services freshness chain from
242 calls to 10) replayed against `bridge-20260825T164102`: every exchange
answered the status the trace carries, no divergence left unexplained, nothing
recognised by a declared rule. Register calls per exchange, legacy against
bridge: 39/37 on the uncompared cold start, then 33/33, 35/35, 43/43.

**Recorded evidence, the first cycle against the bridge, 2026-08-25.** Reference
`legacy-20260825T085605` (4 exchanges, 384 register lines) replayed against the
bridge on `test_invoice_pg_replica`, recording into `bridge-20260825T113535`. The
template forked `pool_0001`, the worker presented at once, 298 register lines
carrying an exchange, none without a `site_caller`. The first exchange answered
200 and the replay STOPPED inside it, at register call 5: `client:new_connection`
answers a connection register item whose key set differs — the reference carries
`datachanges`, `datachanges_idx`, `electron_static`, `register_name` and
`subscribed_paths`, the bridge carries `avatar_extra`, `last_refresh_ts`,
`last_rpc_ts`, `last_user_ts` and `store`. Both `site_caller` chains name the same
site code, `gnrwebpage.py:325 _register_new_page`, so the two stacks reach that
call the same way and answer it differently. Whether it is a rule to declare or a
fault to fix is the owner's judgment, and it is where Phase 6 starts.

## The twin proxy: the owner's own session, on both stacks at once

The replica above replays a recorded session. This does not: the owner browses
through a proxy, and every request he makes is performed twice — first on the
legacy stack, then on the bridge. The LEGACY answer is the one the browser
receives, so a fault on the bridge never blocks his work. The bridge is the
shadow, and what it answers is only ever compared.

One process owns the whole cycle, which reverses the rule the earlier phases
worked under: with a live proxy the orchestration cannot be a sequence of shell
commands, so the copy, the two stacks and the comparison start and stop together.

```bash
GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \
    PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy \
    GNR_DAEMON_PROVIDER=genropy-kajenn PGGSSENCMODE=disable \
    python benchmarks/compare/twin_proxy.py test_invoice_pg_legacy \
    --run "the invoice session"
```

Then browse `http://127.0.0.1:8097`. Nothing else is run by hand.

**What it does, in the order it does it**, and none of the order is a preference:

1. **the db copy** — `dropdb`/`createdb -T` first, because `createdb` needs its
   template free of connections and the template is the database the legacy
   stack is about to open;
2. **the legacy register pickles are deleted** — every comparative run starts
   from an empty register, and a surviving connection would keep the browser
   logged in and leave the login out of the session altogether;
3. **the legacy's own sitedaemon**, waited for on its descriptor — the legacy
   stack is TWO processes, and `SiteRegisterClient` reads the Pyro address out of
   `site/sitedaemon.xml` when the site is built, so gunicorn started first would
   hold an address nobody answers;
4. **gunicorn**, waited for on `Listening at:`;
5. **the bridge**, waited for on `Application startup complete`;
6. **the proxy** on 8097.

Each stack is waited for on its LOG, never on a request: a readiness probe is an
exchange, and the recorder writes it into the archive as a line no session asked
for. A stack that dies on the way up stops the run at once, with its own output
above the message.

**The two instances.** The command line names the instance the LEGACY serves; the
bridge serves that name plus `_asgi` — `sandbox` becomes `sandbox_asgi` (owner,
2026-08-25). The `_asgi` twin is configuration only: the same `root.py` and
`siteconfig.xml`, an `instanceconfig.xml` whose `db` node names the copy, no
`sitedaemon.xml`, no `site/data`, no `_static`. The proxy does not create it — it
refuses and prints the four commands that do.

**`GNR_DAEMON_PROVIDER=genropy-kajenn` is mandatory** and the run refuses without
it. Unset, `gnr.web.daemon.siteregister_client` stays genropy's own client, the
bench's recording client cannot be built on top of it — it binds commands the
classic client reaches through `__getattr__` — and the bridge template dies
importing its engine factory. The legacy child does NOT receive the variable:
on that stack genropy must keep its own daemon client.

**What is dispatched, and what is compared, are two different questions.**
Everything the browser sends is dispatched to both stacks, statics included: the
bridge must see exactly the traffic the legacy sees, or its state could diverge
for a reason the bench introduced. Only the comparison is selective — a static
carries the same pair of register calls every time and says nothing, so it is
dispatched and not compared. Consequence on record: the serving of static assets
is never compared between the two stacks.

**The join** is the replica's own, reached in two steps because the exchange id
is minted inside the stack that serves the request, not by whoever sends it. The
legacy leg carries `X-Bench-Twin-Request`, the proxy's own ordinal; the proxy
reads back the legacy exchange id belonging to it; the bridge leg then carries
`X-Bench-Replica-Of` with that id, which is what `TraceReader` and
`StructuralDiff` already read. Neither module was modified.

**Identifiers and headers.** The bridge mints its own page ids, so the same
`IdentityMap` the replica uses rewrites the tokens in the query string and in the
body. Cookies are never forwarded to the bridge: the browser's jar belongs to the
legacy stack and the proxy keeps a jar of its own for the shadow. Every OTHER
header is forwarded as it came — the user agent among them, because the site
writes it into the connection register item and a missing one would read as a
divergence of the stack.

**The shadow leg runs on a thread of its own** and the request thread waits for
it. Two reasons, each sufficient: SQLite refuses a connection used from a thread
other than the one that opened it, and serving is threaded; and the two legs of a
request stay sequential by construction instead of by a lock somebody has to
remember. Run in parallel they would contend for CPU and for the database and
dirty both timings — sequential warms the second, which is its own bias. Either
way the timings here are indicative: the speed verdict is macro-phase 3's, with
collection off.

**One call, one verdict, and nothing stops** (owner, 2026-08-26). Every request
carries a mark of its own — `twin-00042`, the proxy's own ordinal, stamped on the
legacy leg and carried into both archives — and the unit of comparison is the
single call: it agrees on the two stacks or it diverges, on its own merits,
whatever the calls around it did. So a divergence is a finding about THAT call and
no reason to arrest the run, and with several users the divergence of one must not
end the session of the others. The first-divergence arrest stays where it belongs,
in the replica, which replays one recorded session in a line.

Each divergence is printed and written to a numbered file of its own beside the
archives — `<run>-01-error.txt`, `<run>-02-warning.txt` — naming the call, the
browser and both archives. Both stacks stay up throughout, which is what makes a
divergence investigable while it is fresh, and the closing summary lists every
call that diverged.

**Two weights, because the browser is the judge.**

- **ERROR — what the browser would have seen.** The status AND the whole reply
  body, masked of the identifiers each stack mints and of the clock
  (`ReplyShape`). Nothing else may differ: the reply is what the bridge exists to
  reproduce, and everything the server pushes to the client — datachanges, client
  data — rides inside it. Comparing the status alone would let two 200s with
  different bodies pass as agreement. This check runs on EVERY exchange, cold
  start included: the register rule that excuses those exchanges is about how each
  stack builds itself, and says nothing about what it answered.
- **WARNING — how the two stacks got there.** The sequence of register calls.
  Real, worth a report, and not a failure of the emulation the browser sees.

**Two lines are the same call when the call AND the caller agree.** The alignment
of the two register sequences is keyed on both, because `store:getItem` is made
from all over the site. Keyed on the call alone — measured 2026-08-26 — four
insertions elsewhere slid the alignment, difflib paired a general preference read
with a user preference read, and the report named preferences while the cause was
a service freshness check. The `site_caller` closes it: cut by dotted module name,
it reads identically on the frozen copy the legacy runs and on the checkout the
bridge runs, so it is equal exactly when the two stacks did the same thing.

**Two more declared rules, both from signatures measured here.**

- **`stale-connection`** — the run starts from an empty register and the browser
  still holds the cookie of the run before, so the legacy refuses the call while
  the twin, which inherited nothing, serves it. Told apart from `reference-race`
  by what is missing: a race has an earlier exchange still in flight on the same
  cookie. It lives in the PROXY's table and NOT in the default one, because
  replaying a recorded session a reference 400 from a stale tab IS reproducible
  and must be reported.
- **`service-warmup`** — with one worker per user, the first request of a
  freshly born worker is still resolving storage services; the legacy makes the
  same calls at the startup of its one long-lived process, outside any compared
  exchange. The worker settles what it can at birth (`resources_dirs`,
  `storage('gnr')`, `storage('dojo')`); the tail cannot be pre-warmed without
  instantiating the volume storages, which can be remote, in a just-forked
  process. The rule recognises one thing: a call the replica made and the
  reference did not, whose caller chain passes through the service resolution.
  Two warm-ups that disagree are still a divergence.

**The declared run name.** `--run` is written into both archives — inside
`conditions` and promoted to the `name` column of the `run` row, a copy like every
other promoted column. It is the one declared condition no launcher can read from
where it is true, and it is what makes the two archives of one run findable as a
pair months later.

**Recorded evidence, 2026-08-25.** A login driven through the proxy on
`test_invoice_pg_legacy` against `test_invoice_pg_legacy_asgi`: four exchanges,
every status identical on the two stacks, the first not compared by the cold-start
rule, then register calls 33/33, 35/35 and 43/43 — the same figures the replica
cycle measured — and no divergence. Archives `legacy-20260825T202437` and
`bridge-20260825T202437`.
