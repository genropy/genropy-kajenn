"""Start the legacy stack with both bench recorders installed, recording into a
freshly minted run archive.

The register recorder cannot be installed from a gunicorn hook: `main()` builds
`GnrWsgiSite` before it reads the `-c` configuration file, and the site's
`__init__` forces the register into existence, so the client already exists in
the master process before any hook runs and before the fork. This launcher is
the install point — the assignment below, then genropy's own entry point.

The HTTP recorder keeps its own install point, `post_worker_init` in
`gunicorn_recorders.conf.py`, which runs late on purpose: it needs the loaded
application to wrap. Two recorders, two install points, one command.

This launcher also owns the RUN: it mints the archive with its declared
conditions and publishes the path in `GNR_BENCH_RUN` before the fork, so the
HTTP recorder in the worker attaches to the same file. The register recorder is
handed the archive object directly, through a `partial` — genropy builds its
client as `SiteRegisterClient(site)`, with no room for a second argument.

The conditions are read where they are true and never assumed: the workers, the
threads, the bind and the debug flag from this very command line, the database
from the instance's own `instanceconfig.xml`, the versions from the installed
distributions, the bench commit from git. `GENRO_KJNFOLDER` points genropy at
the bench's own configuration folder, which names the pinned trees — without it
the run reads the developer's `~/.gnr` and is not comparable.

Run, from the repository root:

  GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr PGGSSENCMODE=disable temp/legacy_venv/bin/python \
      benchmarks/compare/serve_legacy.py test_invoice_pg_legacy \
      -b 127.0.0.1:8099 -w 1 -k gthread --threads 16 \
      -c benchmarks/compare/gunicorn_recorders.conf.py

Every argument after the script is genropy's own `serveprod` command line: this
launcher adds nothing to it and takes nothing away. The archive lands in
`GNR_BENCH_ARCHIVE_DIR`, or in `~/genro_bench/runs/` when that is unset.
