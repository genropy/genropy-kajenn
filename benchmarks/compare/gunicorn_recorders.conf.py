"""Gunicorn config installing the bench recorders in each worker.

Usage, from the repository root:

  PGGSSENCMODE=disable temp/legacy_venv/bin/gnr web serveprod test_invoice_pg_legacy \
      -b 127.0.0.1:8099 -w 1 -k gthread --threads 16 \
      -c benchmarks/compare/gunicorn_recorders.conf.py

`post_worker_init` runs right after gunicorn's own `load_wsgi()`, so
`worker.wsgi` is already the site application and wrapping it here is enough
(verified on gunicorn 26.1.0, `Worker.init_process`).

The hook holds no logic of its own: installing a recorder is one call, the same
call the bridge makes in macro-phase 2, where there is no gunicorn at all. The
import lives inside the hook because this directory has to reach `sys.path`
first, after the worker has loaded the application.

# works for any `-c` argument, relative or absolute, from any working directory.
