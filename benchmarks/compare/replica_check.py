"""Isolation checks for the replica: the trace it reads, the exchanges it leaves
out, the identifiers it rewrites, the header it stamps, and the two gates that
stop it before it starts — the pinned genropy, and the two runs writing into two
different databases.

No site, no server, no site database: a throwaway archive and two throwaway
source trees under `temp/`. The replay itself is not exercised here — driving a
live stack is what the phase's own smoke does, and a mocked HTTP server would
assert the mock. What IS asserted is everything that decides WHAT goes on the
wire, which is where a replica gets a comparison wrong.

It runs on the bridge interpreter, because `genropy_parity_check` imports `gnr`
to see which tree this process resolves it from.

Run: python benchmarks/compare/replica_check.py
