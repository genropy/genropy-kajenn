"""The replica: it reads an archived run and performs it again, by network
calls, against a live stack.

There is no script beside the archive. The recorded lines ARE what the replica
reads, so nothing can drift away from what really happened. Any archived run
serves — the reference session is a role, not a format (foreman decision,
2026-08-25): Phase 2 replays the browser session of 2026-08-23 because it is the
one that exercises every identifier the adaptation has to handle.

**What it replays, and what it leaves out.** Two declared rules, and they are
declared because a silent skip is a divergence nobody can see afterwards:

- `/_ping` stays out. It is a browser heartbeat on a timer, and what a ping
  carries depends on when it fires — a replica cannot make that true again.
  Consequence on record: the delivery of datachanges through a ping is never
  compared. In the 2026-08-23 session the rule costs ONE non-empty ping, the
  412 that precedes the login.
- Statics stay out. In that session they are 223 of the 266 exchanges and each
  one produces the same pair of register calls, `globalStore` and `getItem` —
  446 lines carrying no information. Consequence on record: the serving of
  static assets is never compared between the two stacks.

**Identifiers.** A page id minted by one stack means nothing to the other, so
the replica keeps a map from the token in the trace to the token the target
minted in its place, learned from the HTML the target returns, and rewrites it
wherever it appears: in the form values AND in the query string — the GET of a
TH page carries `_calling_page_id` there. Cookies are never replayed: the
client keeps its own jar, and the target's `spa_connection_id` is the one that
counts. What is NOT adapted is `callcounter`: the sequence replayed is the
sequence recorded, so the counter of the trace is the right one.

**The pairing.** Each request carries the exchange id it is replaying, as the
`X-Bench-Replica-Of` request header. The HTTP recorder already writes every
request header into its line, so the replica run's archive says by itself which
reference exchange each of its own exchanges reproduces — no recorder changes,
no new field in the record.

**Order, not timing.** The exchanges go out in the order the trace holds them,
one after another on a single keep-alive connection, with no waiting in
between. A replica reproduces what was done, never how long the hands took.

**And that is why one recorded status can never be reproduced.** A browser
sends calls that overlap; the bench does not. When the reply recorded in the
trace says the connection had already been rotated, AND the trace shows that
exchange running while an earlier one was still in flight on the same
pre-rotation cookie, the recorded status is a RACE of the reference session,
not a divergence of the stack. The replay names it and carries on; it never
passes it in silence. Measured on the 2026-08-23 session: the two `login_doLogin`
calls overlap by 22.8 ms, the first rotates the connection, the second answers
400 — and a replica replaying them one after the other gets the 200 the site
owes a legitimate call. The rule itself lives in the declared-rules table of
`structural_diff.py`, together with everything else the bench recognises instead
of stopping on it.

**And the comparison.** Given the archive the TARGET is recording into, the
replay compares as it goes: after every exchange, the register lines of the
reference and the register lines the target just wrote must carry the same
sequence of calls and the same shape of arguments and answers
(`structural_diff.py`). At the first divergence nothing declares, the replay
stops and prints the report — the two stacks are still standing at that moment,
which is the whole reason this is a replica and not an offline diff of two
finished traces. Without that archive the replay only replays, as it did before.

An exchange the reference raced is replayed and NOT compared: its recorded reply
is a 400 the site owed nobody, so its register lines are the lines of a refused
call. The skip is printed.

**Parity first.** The run refuses to start while the two stacks carry different
genropy source (`genropy_parity_check.py`).

**And the databases stay apart.** The bridge writes from the first exchange —
that is what the copied db is for — so a cross-stack comparison refuses to start
while the target writes into the database the reference was recorded on: the
reference's own data would move under it, and no later run could reproduce what
it holds. The question is asked of the PAIR and only ACROSS stacks: a run
replayed against its own stack shares the database with its reference by
construction, and that self-check is what validates the comparison itself.
