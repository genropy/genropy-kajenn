"""Do the two stacks run the same genropy? The comparison refuses to start until
they do.

**One pinned tree, and both stacks read it.** The bench does not follow the
genropy the developer happens to have checked out — that tree moves under the
bench between one run and the next, and a difference between two runs then reads
as a difference between the stacks. Measured on 2026-08-25: the checkout had
moved onto a branch whose one commit removes the register read for services not
configured in the database, which is 242 of the 384 register calls a login
makes. The bridge was already running it. The legacy stack was not.

So the bench declares a genropy of its own — a detached worktree — and the two
stacks reach it differently, because they are installed differently:

- the **bridge** imports it directly, put first on the import path by
  `PYTHONPATH`, which wins over the editable install of the developer's own
  checkout (measured 2026-08-25: the editable finder appends itself to
  `sys.meta_path`, so the ordinary path lookup answers first);
- the **legacy** stack imports a frozen copy inside `temp/legacy_venv`, so what
  is asked of it is not a path but the same content.

Hence the two questions this asks, and they are not the same question:

1. is this interpreter importing the pinned tree, or something else?
2. does the frozen copy carry the same source as the pinned tree?

**What the two stacks share by construction.** `resources/`, `packages/`,
`webtools/` and the two static trees are named by the bench's own
`environment.xml`, which both launchers point at through `GENRO_KJNFOLDER`. Both
stacks therefore read the same directories, and there is nothing to compare: a
shared tree is parity by definition. `projects/` stays on the developer's
checkout, where the bench instances live untracked — the bench application is
not genropy, and both stacks read that one too.

**What is compared, then.** Only `*.py`, only inside the `gnr` package, never
`__pycache__`, and never the five top-level subtrees the wheel copies in but no
runtime reads there — `projects`, `resources`, `webtools`, `dojo_libs`, `gnrjs`.
With them out the two sets match file for file (320 against 320, measured
2026-08-25), and any asymmetry left is real drift.

This is a REFUSAL, not a warning: it names what is wrong, prints the remedy, and
exits non-zero. `replica.py` calls it first at every cycle start.
