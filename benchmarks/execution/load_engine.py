"""The load generator, identical for both stacks: a global pace, one thread per user.

The trace declares WHEN each request is offered; the engine offers it at that
instant and never waits for the answer before offering the next. Each user has
its own session, its own connection and its own queue, so requests of different
users overlap while the same user never has two in flight — which is what a
browser does.

Nothing here knows whether it is talking to the bridge or to Gunicorn. The
stack-specific observations — census, journal, topology — live in the driver that
owns this engine, and the mandate is explicit that they must not change the load
sent. That is why they are absent from this file.

Migration corrections (2026-09-09): pending work includes requests on the wire;
CSV writes share the accounting lock; delay drift uses scheduled order. These
changes affect new measurements only and must not silently rewrite old reports.

THREE COUNTS, THREE INSTANTS. The previous scenario reported ``started`` and
``completed`` from the same list, so the two numbers were equal by construction
and a request that went on the wire but never came back was invisible. Here:

- OFFERED is a row of the trace whose instant has arrived;
- STARTED is a request handed to the socket;
- COMPLETED is a finished logical call, including a transport failure.
  ``responses_received`` counts only calls for which an HTTP response was read.

THREE KINDS OF ERROR, KEPT APART. An HTTP status that is not 200; an application
error inside a 200 body; and a transport exception. The old driver merged the
three into one counter and a retry made them ambiguous.
