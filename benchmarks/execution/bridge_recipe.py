"""Recording configuration mirroring the shipped bridge recipe.

PROVISIONAL: this copy changes only worker_class and engine_factory. The full
recipe equivalence check guards drift, including optional applications and
orchestration defaults. Keep this in the bridge laboratory, not the generic core.

Used by the ``genropy-kajenn`` CLI: a normal multi-app ``AsgiServer`` on which the
genropy instance is mounted on the root. The variable elements (the resolved
instance ``path``, host/port/debug, the installation paths, the idle valve)
come from the environment; the rest of the recipe is fixed. No register daemon
in either shape: the register is served in-process, on each worker.

ONE shape: a single ``GenropySpaApplication`` whose pool is declared here, under
its ``orchestration`` node — ``orchestration.commander`` and, below that, one
group named ``pool`` (the cemented decision: one group, the reception serves the
guests). There is no worker count to declare and no single/pool selector: the
pool always runs and sizes itself. A ``KAJENN_WORKERS`` still set in the
environment is reported by the CLI and ignored.

The group sets ``cpu_retirement_quiet_seconds=60.0`` explicitly; every other
threshold is the core's own default.

The environment enters the tree as VALUES read at recipe-build time: the CLI
writes the variables just before the server is built, and ``main()`` runs
during that build. ``EnvResolver`` stays only where the core grammar declares
resolver-typed attributes (host/port).

The two installation paths and the valve, overridable per installation:

- ``KAJENN_FROZEN_USERS_PATH`` — the freezer root; durable by necessity
  (a frozen user is kept for days), so it defaults INSIDE the site's own
  ``data`` directory.
- ``KAJENN_INSTANCE_DIR`` — where the workers' sockets live; ephemeral,
  so it defaults under the system temp directory (UDS paths must stay
  short).
- ``KAJENN_IDLE_FREEZE_MINUTES`` — the silence past which a user is
  parked in the freezer. Unset, the worker reads the site's ``<cleanup>``
  section (``connection_max_age`` seconds, 7200 where the site is silent).
- ``KAJENN_CONSOLE`` — set to any value, the pool's debug door is mounted
  on ``_console`` as MCP tools: an expression is evaluated inside the
  commander or inside a named worker, and its ``repr`` comes back. It reads
  the live registers WITHOUT going through the site, so looking does not mint
  a cid nor open a connection — an observer that leaves no trace in what it
  observes. The door is full ``eval`` by construction, so mounting IS the
  gate (core doctrine): unset here means the door does not exist, and a
  production environment never sets it.
- ``KAJENN_ORCHESTRATION_PROFILES`` — set to any value, mounts the named
  JSON profile editor below ``/_sysop/configuration`` and its MCP tools below
  ``/_sysop/mcp``. Unset, the write surface does not exist. Profiles default
  to ``<site>/data/_orchestration_profiles``; move them with
  ``KAJENN_ORCHESTRATION_PROFILES_PATH``.
