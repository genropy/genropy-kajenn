"""Start the bridge with both bench recorders installed, recording into a freshly
minted run archive. The counterpart of ``serve_legacy.py``, on the other stack.

What it owns is the RUN, not the install: the recorders are installed by the
bench recipe naming the recording worker (``bridge_recipe.py``), which is what
"the install rides the recipe" means. This launcher exists because building a
recipe must stay free of consequences — a recipe that minted an archive could
not be built by the drift check — and because one place has to read the
declared conditions and publish the archive before the first worker is spawned.

Three things happen here, in order, and all three must precede the spawn:

- the repository root goes on the import path inherited by workers: the recipe
  names the recording classes by their canonical ``benchmarks.recording`` modules;
- the archive is minted with the conditions of this run and its path published
  in ``GNR_BENCH_RUN`` — the environment is the only channel that reaches a
  worker the pool starts fresh, since no object crosses a spawn;
- the CLI is handed the command line, with the bench recipe appended to it.

The conditions are read where each one is true and never assumed: the site from
the path the CLI resolves, the database from the instance's own
``instanceconfig.xml``, the versions from the installed distributions, and the
commits from the working trees behind them. On this side genropy, kajenn
and genropy-kajenn are all installed EDITABLE, so a version string records when
the package was installed while the commit records the code that actually ran —
the legacy stack runs a frozen copy of the same genropy tree, and only the
commits make that visible.

Run, from the repository root:

  GENRO_KJNFOLDER=$PWD/temp/gnr \
      PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Sviluppo/genropy/genropy/worktrees/bench-baseline/gnrpy \
      PGGSSENCMODE=disable python -m benchmarks.execution.serve_bridge test_invoice_pg \
      -p 8098 --nodebug

`PYTHONPATH` is what puts the bench's pinned genropy ahead of the editable one
in the developer's pyenv, and `GENRO_KJNFOLDER` points at the configuration that
names the pinned resources and packages. Both are read at import time, so they
belong on the command line and not in this launcher.

Every argument is the ``gnrkajenn`` command line: this launcher adds only
``--config``, and refuses to override one the caller named. The archive lands
in ``GNR_BENCH_ARCHIVE_DIR``, or in ``~/genro_bench/runs/`` when that is unset —
the same place the legacy runs go, so the two references sit side by side.
