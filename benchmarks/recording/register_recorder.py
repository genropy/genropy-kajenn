"""Register recorder for the legacy/bridge comparison bench.

A wrapper OBJECT standing in place of `SiteRegisterClient`: it builds the real
client, holds it, and catches every attribute through its own `__getattr__`, so
the methods declared on the legacy class are recorded together with the names
that class's own `__getattr__` passes through. Installed by one assignment, and
the same assignment serves on the bridge:

    gnr.web.gnrwsgisite.SiteRegisterClient = RegisterRecorder

The assignment must happen BEFORE the site is built: `gnrserveprod.main()`
constructs `GnrWsgiSite` before it reads the gunicorn `-c` file, and
`GnrWsgiSite.__init__` forces the register into existence, so no gunicorn hook
is early enough. `serve_legacy.py` is that install point.

One `register` line per call in the run archive, joined to the HTTP lines by the
`exchange_id` the HTTP recorder injects as the `X-Bench-Exchange-Id` request
header and this recorder reads back through `site.currentRequest`. The
calls the master makes while building the site happen before any exchange
exists: the `exchange_id` key is then ABSENT from the record — never faked and
never inherited from whatever ran last on that thread.

What a line carries: the verb, the surface it was intercepted on (`client` for a
method declared on the legacy class, `passthrough` for a name its `__getattr__`
forwards, `store` for a call on a `ServerStore`), the site code that made the
call, the arguments and the answer,
the wire attempts and the error class, the ordinal within its
exchange, the duration, thread and pid. Store lines carry as well the
`register_name` and `register_item_id` of the store the call happened on.

`site_caller` is that site code: the three outermost-going frames outside the
recorder and outside the register client, innermost first, joined by ` <- `. It
is what turns a count of calls
into a diagnosis — a divergence of two register calls says nothing until the two
lines name who asked. Three frames and not one, decided by the owner on
2026-08-24 after the first measurement: 242 of the 384 calls a login makes come
from the service cache check inside genropy, whose innermost frame is always the
same two lines of `gnr/lib/services/__init__.py` and never says which site code
asked for the service. The instrument may cost time in the fidelity phases —
what it must not do is cost time in macro-phase 3, which reads the durations.
The file is cut down to the path its dotted module name
implies, because the two stacks run the same genropy from different places (a
frozen copy under `temp/legacy_venv`, an editable checkout under
`genropy/gnrpy`) and two absolute paths would read as a divergence produced by
the instrument. The module name is what says where the package begins, and the
filesystem is not: walking up while `__init__.py` exists overshot on the
editable side — measured, `gnrpy/` carries one too — and the same file came out
as `gnr/lib/services/__init__.py` on one stack and `gnrpy/gnr/lib/services/__init__.py`
on the other. A resource loaded under a flat module name — genropy loads its project
resources that way — has no dots to count, and keeps its last three path
segments instead: `packages/adm/model/preference.py`, the same on both stacks
and enough to find the file. A frame with no module name, or `__main__` — a script run by hand —
keeps its absolute path: both stacks run the same project directory, so
it compares anyway.

The frames to skip are derived, never listed: this module, the module of the
recorder's own class, and the modules of every class in the client's MRO. The
bridge recorder therefore needs no walk of its own — its client is a subclass,
so the mixin's module comes in with the MRO.

`wire_calls` counts the round trips one call cost, and it is counted on the Pyro
proxy rather than guessed: the legacy retry loop lives inside the closure
`SiteRegisterClient.__getattr__` builds, and its `except Exception` neither logs
nor re-raises, so from outside that funnel a fourfold failure is
indistinguishable from a legitimate `None`. Counting on the wire and attributing
to the call in flight keeps ONE line per call the site made — never one per round
trip.

The field is NOT called `attempts`, and the name was changed after it misled its
first reader: a store's Bag read shows `wire_calls: 2` because
`ServerStore.data` evaluates `self.register_item` twice, each evaluation a round
trip of its own — measured, not a retry. A retry shows as more round trips than
the call's shape costs, together with a `wire_error`.

Only non-routine attributes are handed back untouched, and the guard is
`inspect.isroutine`, not `callable`: `register.locked_exception` is a class, so
it is callable, and a wrapped class stops matching the `except` clause that uses
it — silently, in a path that only runs once something has already gone wrong.

The archive opens its connection per process, never inherited across the fork:
the wrapper is born in the master and every worker records afterwards. Without an
archive the recorder attaches to the run the launcher published in
`GNR_BENCH_RUN` (`run_archive.py`) — a constructor argument is not an option
here, because genropy builds its client as `SiteRegisterClient(site)`.

Values are written so that two runs can be compared: a Bag goes in as its XML,
because the default `repr` carries no content and a memory address that changes
at every run would read as a divergence; anything else goes in as its `repr`
with the address removed. Long values are truncated with their real length.

A failure inside the recorder is written to the archive as `recorder_error` and
never reaches the site.
