"""Register recorder for the BRIDGE side of the comparison bench.

The legacy client hands most of its surface to a generic ``__getattr__``, so
there a wrapper OBJECT standing in front of it catches everything by
construction. The bridge's ``GenropyRegisterClient`` is the opposite: every
command it serves is an explicit method with its own body and there is no
funnel at all. So here the recorder is a MIXIN — the recording client is a real
SUBCLASS of the bridge's client, and each recorded verb is an override that
records the call and then delegates to the parent's own implementation.

Installed by the same assignment the legacy uses, from the recording worker:

    gnr.web.gnrwsgisite.SiteRegisterClient = RecordingRegisterClient

The record shape is the legacy one, unchanged: the machinery that builds a line
is inherited from ``register_recorder.RegisterRecorder`` rather than rewritten,
so the two stacks cannot drift in what a line carries. What differs is only how
the calls are caught, and the comparison reads lines, never mechanisms.

The price of a mixin is ``RECORDED_VERBS``: a list of names that can silently
fall behind the client it shadows, which the legacy wrapper never could.
``bridge_coverage_check.py`` is the tripwire — it compares this tuple against
the client's live surface and fails when they diverge.

**Only the outermost call is recorded.** A line is a call the SITE made, which
on legacy came for free: the wrapper is not in the client's internal call path,
so a command calling another command produced one line. A subclass IS in that
path, and the bridge's client calls six of its own public commands internally
(``get_item``, ``local_item``, ``pages``, ``set_datachange``,
``set_serverstore_changes``, ``subscribe_path``), while every ``ServerStore``
delegates its whole conversation back to the client that made it. Recorded
naively, the bridge's trace would carry lines the legacy one cannot have, and
macro-phase 2 would read a divergence produced by the instrument. So a call
that starts while another is already being recorded runs untouched.

**Two fields tell the truth about this stack instead of imitating the other.**
``surface`` is always ``client``: there is no ``__getattr__`` to pass through,
so the ``passthrough`` lines of the legacy trace have no counterpart here.
``wire_calls`` is always 1: the register lives inside the worker's own process
and no call costs a round trip. Both are real differences between the stacks,
not artefacts of measurement.
