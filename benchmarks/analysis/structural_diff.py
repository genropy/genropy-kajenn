"""The structural comparison: two archived runs, exchange by exchange, and the
first difference that nothing declares.

The reference run and the replica run are joined by the `X-Bench-Replica-Of`
request header the replica stamps on every call it sends (`replica.py`): the
replica run's own archive says which reference exchange each of its exchanges
reproduces, so nothing outside the two archives has to be kept in step.

**Two lines are the same call when the call AND the caller agree.** The
alignment of the two sequences is keyed on both, because `store:getItem` is made
from all over the site: keyed on the call alone, the alignment pairs a general
preference read with a user preference read and reports their arguments as a
difference, while the real difference — an insertion elsewhere — goes unnamed
(measured 2026-08-26).

**Equal means equal by STRUCTURE.** Two exchanges agree when their register
lines carry the same sequence of calls and the same SHAPE of arguments and
answers. The shape is what survives a second run of the same session; the value
often is not, and a comparison that reads values reports the clock and the
random identifiers as differences of the stack:

- a 22-character identifier — page id, connection id, register item id — is
  masked, wherever it sits inside a longer string;
- a timestamp, a date and a `datetime.datetime(...)` repr are masked;
- an answer that is a Bag goes in as the PATHS of its nodes, with the values
  dropped and the attribute NAMES kept;
- an answer that is a dict repr goes in as the NAMES of its keys, values
  dropped: a register item that grows or loses a key is a difference, a
  register item whose `start_ts` moved is not;
- everything else is compared as its masked text, numbers included — a count
  that changes is a difference, and one of the cheapest to read.

The CALL is the surface plus the verb, and `client` and `passthrough` are one
surface here: they say how the recorder reached the method inside the register
client, not what the site asked, and the site cannot tell them apart. `store`
stays its own surface.

Measured on the pair of 2026-08-23/2026-08-25 (the browser session and its own
replay): 636 lines of the exchanges whose call sequence already agreed, 29
differing on the raw answer, 12 on the shape — and those 12 are real, four of
them a register item that carries three keys on one side and not on the other.

**What does not stop the run.** A difference recognised by a DECLARED rule is
reported as known and the replay carries on. The table is a mechanism with one
entry today, the reference race Phase 2 measured, and a rule is written only
from a signature somebody observed: the known bridge divergences of
`temp/problemi_kajenn_dal_ponte_2026-08-22.md` (S1, S2, S3, S5) are facts
between workers, invisible on a legacy-vs-legacy run, so their rules are added
when the first bridge cycle shows them and not before (foreman, 2026-08-25).

**Where the report is read.** Not here. `replica.py` asks this module after every
exchange it replays and stops at the first divergence nothing declares, printing
the report below — the run stops while the two stacks are still standing, which
is the whole point of a replica rather than an offline diff of two finished
traces (owner, 2026-08-23).
